CHAPTER 1

Orientation
1.1 – Setting the context
Before we start this module on Option Strategy, I would like to share with you a
Behavioral Finance article I read couple of years ago. The article was titled “Why
winning is addictive”.
Here is the article, authored by B.Venkatesh (a regular columnist for HBL) –
“To buy and bet on a lottery ticket – a game that you typically avoid because you
understand the odds of winning the jackpot is really low. However, if you do win the
ticket, you will be most likely tempted to buy a lottery ticket regularly thereafter!
We exhibit similar behavior when it comes to our investments as well. What drives such
behavior? As humans, our life is governed by anticipation. So, looking forward to
winning a lottery is exciting and so is realizing that expectation.
Research in neuroscience has however shown that anticipating a win is more exciting
than actual winning! Nevertheless, once you experience the excitement of winning a
lottery you feel the need to indulge. That is, your brain compels you to buy a lottery
ticket, even though you are aware of the odds of winning the second one.
This happens because we tend to use more of reflexive brain than reflective brain. The
reflective brain performs calculation that helps you analyze and think. The reflexive
brain helps you feel and is more intuitive. When you feel an urge to buy a lottery ticket,
it is your reflexive brain that is pushing you to do so. Your reflective brain is likely to tell
you that the odds of winning the jackpot for the second time are low!
Now consider trading in equity options. You know that buying calls and puts has its risk,
as options often expire worthless. Yet we may choose to buy them regularly, especially if
we have already experienced large gains from such investments, for it is the reflexive
brain in action. With trading options there is another factor at play. We know that

zerodha.com/varsity

options carry the risk of losing capital when our view on the underlying stock or the
index turns wrong.
The fact that we can lose money makes our experience of winning against such odds
even more exciting! This is not so much true of lottery because a lottery is a game of
chance while investments, we believe, require some degree of skill”
You maybe be wondering, why I chose to post the above article right at the beginning of
this module. Well, this article echoes some of my own thoughts; in fact it goes a step
further to put things in the behavioral finance context. From the many interactions that
I’ve have had with both experienced and aspiring options traders, one point is quite
common - most options traders treat options trading as a ‘hit or miss” kind of a trade.
There is always a sense of amusement when one initiates an option trade, many don’t
realize how fatal this naïve amusement can be.
Traders buy options (month after month) with a hope they would double their
investment. Trading options with such a mindset is a perfect recipe for a P&L disaster.
The bottom line is this – if you aspire to trade options, you need to do it the right way
and follow the right approach. Else you can be rest assured the gambling attitude will
eventually consume your entire trading capital and you will end up having a short, self
destructive option trading career.

I do have to mention this now - the common phrase that goes like this (w.r.t options)
“limited risk, unlimited profit potential” is a silent P&L killer. Newbie traders are
disillusioned by this ‘theoretically correct’ but practically disastrous fact and thereby end
up blowing up their books, slowly and steadily. Hence I do believe that trading options
blindly without a strategy is a “dangerous but irresistible pass time” (courtesy - Pink
Floyd).
I don’t intend to scare you with this note; I’m only trying to set the context here. With
the previous module on Options Theory, I’m sure you would have realized that unlike
other topics in the markets, the science involved in Options is heavy duty. It can be quite
overwhelming, but you will have to trust me here – the only way to understand and
master options trading is by structuring your learning path with a good judicious mix of
theory and practice.
In this module, I will attempt to give you a good overview of what you really need to
know about some of the popular options strategies. Like always, I will try and stick to
the practical aspect and ignore the unwanted (and confusing) theory part.

As far as I’m aware, there are close to 475 options strategies out there in the public
domain and I’m sure at least another 100 odd strategies are hidden in the proprietary
books of brokers, bankers, and traders. Given this should you know all these strategies
put up in the public domain?
Answer is a simple no.

1.2 – What should you know?
You only need to know a handful of strategies but you need to know them really well.
Once you know these strategies all you need to do is analyze the current state of markets
(or the stock) and map it with the right option strategy from your strategy quiver.
Keeping this in perspective we will discuss certain strategies.

2. Volatility Arbitrage employing Dynamic Delta hedging

The plan is to discuss one option strategy per chapter so that there is ample clarity about
the strategy, without any mix up or confusion. This means to say we will have roughly
about 20 chapters in this module, although I suppose each chapter would not be too
lengthy. For each of the strategy I will discuss the background, implementation, payoff,
breakeven, and perhaps the right strikes to use considering the time to expiry. I also
intend to share a working excel model which would come handy if you intent to employ
the strategy.
Do note, while I will discuss all these strategies keeping the Nifty Index as reference, you
can use the same for any stock options.
Now here is the most important thing I want you to be aware of – do not expect a holy
grail in this module. None of the strategies that we discuss here in the module is sure
shot money making machine; in fact nothing is in the markets. The objective here in this
module is to ensure that we discuss few basic but important strategies, if you deploy
them right you can make money.
Think about this way – if you have a nice car and drive it properly, you can use it to
commute and ensure comfort of yourself and your family. However if you are rash with
the car, then it can be dangerous to you and everyone else around you.
Likewise these strategies make money if you use it right; if you don’t then they can
create a hole in your P&L. My job here is to help you understand these strategies (help
you learn how to drive the car) and I will also attempt to explain the best condition
under which you can use these strategies. But making sure it works for you is in your
control, this really depends on your discipline and reading of markets. Having said this,
I’m reasonably certain your application of strategies will improve as and when you
spend more ‘quality’ time in the markets.
So starting from the next chapter we focus on the Bullish strategies with the ‘Bull Call
Spread’ making its debut.
Stay tuned.

CHAPTER 2

Bull Call Spread
2.1 – Background
The spread strategies are some of the simplest option strategies that a trader can
implement. Spreads are multi leg strategies involving 2 or more options. When I say
multi leg strategies, it implies the strategy requires 2 or more option transactions.
Spread strategy such as the ‘Bull Call Spread’ is best implemented when your outlook on
the stock/index is ‘moderate’ and not really ‘aggressive’. For example the outlook on a
particular stock could be ‘moderately bullish’ or ‘moderately bearish’.
Some of the typical scenarios where your outlook can turn ‘moderately bullish’ are
outlined as below –
Fundamental perspective - Reliance Industries is expected to make its Q3 quarterly
results announcement. From the management’s Q2 quarterly guidance you know that
the Q3 results are expected to be better than both Q2 and Q3 of last year. However you
do not know by how many basis points the results will be better. This is clearly the
missing part of the puzzle.
Given this you expect the stock price to react positively to the result announcement.
However because the guidance was laid out in Q2 the market could have kind of
factored in the news. This leads you to think that the stock can go up, but with a limited
upside.
Technical Perspective – The stock that you are tracking has been in the down trend
for a while, so much so that it is at a 52 week low, testing the 200 day moving average,
and also near a multi-year support. Given all this there is a high probability that the
stock could stage a relief rally. However you are not completely bullish as whatever said
and done the stock is still in a downtrend.

zerodha.com/varsity

Quantitative Perspective – The stock is consistently trading between the 1st standard
deviation both ways (+1 SD & -1 SD), exhibiting a consistent mean reverting behavior.
However there has been a sudden decline in the stock price, so much so that the stock
price is now at the 2nd standard deviation. There is no fundamental reason backing the
stock price decline, hence there is a good chance that the stock price could revert to
mean. This makes you bullish on the stock, but the fact that it there is a chance that it
could spend more time near the 2nd SD before reverting to mean caps your bullish
outlook on the stock.
The point here is – your perspective could be developed from any theory (fundamental,
technical, or quantitative) and you could find yourself in a ‘moderately bullish’ stance. In
fact this is true for a ‘moderately bearish’ stance as well. In such a situation you can
simply invoke a spread strategy wherein you can set up option positions in such a way
that
1. You protect yourself on the downside (in case you are proved wrong)
2. The amount of profit that you make is also predefined (capped)
3. As a trade off (for capping your profits) you get to participate in the market for a lesser
cost

The 3rd point could be a little confusing at this stage; you will get clarity on it as we
proceed.

2.2 – Strategy notes
Amongst all the spread strategies, the bull call spread is one the most popular one. The
strategy comes handy when you have a moderately bullish view on the stock/index.
The bull call spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ATM and OTM
options. However you can create the bull call spread using other strikes as well.
To implement the bull call spread –
1. Buy 1 ATM call option (leg 1)
2. Sell 1 OTM call option (leg 2)

When you do this ensure –
1. All strikes belong to the same underlying
2. Belong to the same expiry series

zerodha.com/varsity

8

3. Each leg involves the same number of options

For example –
Date – 23rd November 2015
Outlook – Moderately bullish (expect the market to go higher but the expiry around the
corner could limit the upside)
Nifty Spot – 7846
ATM – 7800 CE, premium – Rs.79/OTM – 7900 CE, premium – Rs.25/Bull Call Spread, trade set up 1. Buy 7800 CE by paying 79 towards the premium. Since money is going out of my
account this is a debit transaction
2. Sell 7900 CE and receive 25 as premium. Since I receive money, this is a credit
transaction
3. The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 79 – 25 = 54.

Generally speaking in a bull call spread there is always a ‘net debit’, hence the bull call
spread is also called referred to as a ‘debit bull spread’.
After we initiate the trade, the market can move in any direction and expiry at any level.
Therefore let us take up a few scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bull
call spread for different levels of expiry.
Scenario 1 - Market expires at 7700 (below the lower strike price i.e ATM
option)
The value of the call options would depend upon its intrinsic value. If you recall from the
previous module, the intrinsic value of a call option upon expiry is –
Max [0, Spot-Strike]
In case of 7800 CE, the intrinsic value would be –
zerodha.com/varsity

9

Max [0, 7700 – 7800]
= Max [0, -100]
=0
Since the 7800 (ATM) call option has 0 intrinsic value we would lose the entire
premium paid i.e Rs.79/The 7900 CE option also has 0 intrinsic value, but since we have sold/written this
option we get to retain the premium of Rs.25.
So our net payoff from this would be –
-79 + 25
= 54
Do note, this is also the net debit of the overall strategy.
Scenario 2 - Market expires at 7800 (at the lower strike price i.e the ATM
option)
I will skip the math here, but you need to know that both 7800 and 7900 would have 0
intrinsic value, therefore the net loss would be 54.
Scenario 3 - Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price, i.e the OTM
option)
The intrinsic value of the 7800 CE would be –
Max [0, Spot-Strike]
= Max [0, 7900 – 7800]
= 100
Since we are long on this option by paying a premium of 79, we would make a profit of –

zerodha.com/varsity

10

100 -79
= 21
The intrinsic value of 7900 CE would be 0, therefore we get to retain the premium
Rs.25/Net profit would be 21 + 25 = 46
Scenario 4 - Market expires at 8000 (above the higher strike price, i.e the
OTM option)
Both the options would have a positive intrinsic value
7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, and the 7900 CE would have an intrinsic
value of 100.
On the 7800 CE we would make 200 – 79 = 121 in profit
And on the 7900 CE we would lose 100 – 25 = 75
The overall profit would be
121 – 75
= 46
To summarize –
Market Expiry LS – IV HS – IV Net pay off
7700

(54)

7800

0

0

(54)

7900

100

0

+46

8000

200

100

+46

From this, 2 things should be clear to you –
1. Irrespective of the down move in the market, the loss is restricted to Rs.54, the
maximum loss also happens to be the ‘net debit’ of the strategy
zerodha.com/varsity

11

2. The maximum profit is capped to 46. This also happens to be the difference between the
spread and strategy’s net debit

We can define the ‘Spread’ as Spread = Difference between the higher and lower strike price
We can calculate the overall profitability of the strategy for any given expiry value. Here
is screenshot of the calculations that I made on the excel sheet –



LS – IV - Lower Strike - Intrinsic value (7800 CE, ATM)



PP – Premium Paid



LS Payoff – Lower Strike Payoff



HS-IV – Higher strike - Intrinsic Value (7900 CE, OTM)



PR – Premium Received



HS Payoff – Higher Strike Payoff

As you can notice, the loss is restricted to Rs.54, and the profit is capped to 46. Given
this,we can generalize the Bull Call Spread to identify the Max loss and Max profit levels
as -

zerodha.com/varsity

12

Bull Call Spread Max loss = Net Debit of the Strategy
Net Debit = Premium Paid for lower strike – Premium Received for higher strike
Bull Call Spread Max Profit = Spread – Net Debit
This is how the pay off diagram of the Bull Call Spread looks like –

There are three important points to note from the payoff diagram –
1. The strategy makes a loss in Nifty expires below 7800. However the loss is restricted to
Rs.54.
2. The breakeven point (where the strategy neither make a profit or loss) is achieved when
the market expires at 7854 (7800 + 54). Therefore we can generalize the breakeven point
for a bull call spread as Lower Strike + Net Debit
3. The strategy makes money if the market moves above 7854, however the maximum
profit achievable is Rs.46 i.e the difference between the strikes minus the net debit
a. 7900 – 7800 = 100
b. 100 – 54 = 46

I suppose at this stage you may be wondering why anyone would choose to implement a
bull call spread versus buying a plain vanilla call option. Well, the main reason is the
reduced strategy cost.

zerodha.com/varsity

13

Do remember your outlook is ‘moderately bullish’. Given this buying an OTM option is
ruled out. If you were to buy the ATM option you would have to pay Rs.79 as the option
premium and if the market proves you wrong, you stand to lose Rs.79. However by
implementing a bull call spread you reduce the overall cost to Rs.54 from Rs.79. As a
tradeoff you also cap your upside. In my view this is a fair deal considering you are not
aggressively bullish on the stock/index.

2.3 – Strike Selection
How would you quantify moderately bullish/bearish? Would you consider a 5% move on
Infosys as moderately bullish move, or should it be 10% and above? What about the
index such as Bank Nifty and Nifty 50? What about mid caps stocks such as Yes Bank,
Mindtree, Strides Arcolab etc? Well, clearly there is no one shoe fits all solution here.
One can attempt to quantify the ‘moderate-ness’ of the move by evaluating the
stock/index volatility.
Based on volatility I have devised a few rules (works alright for me) you may want to
improvise on it further - If the stock is highly volatile, then I would consider a move of 58% as ‘moderate’. However if the stock is not very volatile I would consider sub 5% as
‘moderate’. For indices I would consider sub 5% as moderate.
Now consider this - you have a ‘moderately bullish’ view on Nifty 50 (sub 5% move),
given this which are the strikes to select for the bull call spread? Is the ATM + OTM
combo the best possible spread?
The answer to this depends on good old Theta!
Here are a bunch of graphs that will help you identify the best possible strikes based on
time to expiry.

zerodha.com/varsity

14

Before understanding the graphs above a few things to note –
1. Nifty spot is assumed to be at 8000
2. Start of the series is defined as anytime during the first 15 days of the series
3. End of the series is defined as anytime during the last 15 days of the series
4. The bull call spread is optimized and the spread is created with 300 points difference

The thought here is that the market will move up moderately by about 3.75% i.e from
8000 to 8300. So considering the move and the time to expiry, the graphs above suggest
–
1. Graph 1 (top left) - You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move
over the next 5 days, then a bull spread with far OTM is most profitable i.e 8600 (lower
strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short)

zerodha.com/varsity

15

2. Graph 2 (top right) - You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move
over the next 15 days, then a bull spread with slightly OTM is most profitable i.e 8200
and 8500
3. Graph 3 (bottom left) - You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the
move in 25 days, then a bull spread with ATM is most profitable i.e 8000 and 8300. It
is also interesting to note that the strikes above 8200 (OTM options) make a loss.
4. Graph 4 (bottom right) - You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the
move to occur by expiry, then a bull spread with ATM is most profitable i.e 8000 and
8300. Do note, the losses with OTM and far OTM options deepen.

Here are another bunch of charts; the only difference is that for the same move (i.e
3.75%) these charts suggest the best possible strikes to select assuming you are in the
2nd half of the series.

zerodha.com/varsity

16

1. Graph 1 (top left) – If you expect a moderate move during the 2nd half of the series,
and you expect the move to happen within a day (or two) then the best strikes to opt
are far OTM i.e 8600 (lower strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short)
2. Graph 2 (top right) - If you expect a moderate move during the 2nd half of the series,
and you expect the move to happen over the next 5 days then the best strikes to opt are
far OTM i.e 8600 (lower strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short). Do note, both
Graph 1 and 2 are suggesting the same strikes, but the profitability of the strategy
reduces, thanks to the effect of Theta!
3. Graph 3 (bottom right) - If you expect a moderate move during the 2nd half of the
series, and you expect the move to happen over the next 10 days then the best strikes to
opt are slightly OTM (1 strike away from ATM)
4. Graph 4 (bottom left) - If you expect a moderate move during the 2nd half of the
series, and you expect the move to happen on expiry day, then the best strikes to opt
are ATM i.e 8000 (lower strike, long) and 8300 (higher strike, short). Do note, far OTM
options lose money even if the market moves up.

2.3 – Creating Spreads
Here is something you should know, wider the spread, higher is the amount of money
you can potentially make, but as a trade off the breakeven also increases.
To illustrate –
Today is 28th November, the first day of the December series. Nifty spot is at 7883,
consider 3 different bull call spreads –
Set 1 – Bull call spread with ITM and ATM strikes
Lower Strike (ITM, Long)

7700

Higher Strike (ATM, short)

7800

Spread

7800 – 7700 = 100

Lower Strike Premium Paid

296

Higher Strike Premium Received 227
Net Debit

296 – 227 = 69

Max Loss (same as net debit)

69

Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)

100 – 69 = 31

Breakeven

7700 + 69 = 7769
zerodha.com/varsity

17

Remarks

Considering the outlook is moderately bullish,
7769 breakeven is easily achievable,
however the max profit is 31,
skewing the risk (69 pts) to reward (31 pts) ratio.

Set 2 – Bull call spread with ATM and OTM strikes (classic combo)
Lower Strike (ATM, Long)

7800

Higher Strike (ATM, short)

7900

Spread

7900 – 7800 = 100

Lower Strike Premium Paid

227

Higher Strike Premium Received 167
Net Debit

227 - 167 = 60

Max Loss (same as net debit)

60

Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)

100 – 60 = 40

Breakeven

7800 + 60 = 7860

Remarks

Risk reward is better, but the breakeven is higher

Set 3 – Bull call spread with OTM and OTM strikes
Lower Strike (ATM, Long)

7900

Higher Strike (ATM, short)

8000

Spread

8000 – 7900 = 100

Lower Strike Premium Paid

167

Higher Strike Premium Received 116
Net Debit

167 - 116 = 51

Max Loss (same as net debit)

51

Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)

100 – 51 = 49

Breakeven

7900 + 51 = 7951

Remarks

Risk reward is attractive, but the breakeven is higher

So the point is that, the risk reward changes based on the strikes that you choose.
However don’t just let the risk reward dictate the strikes that you choose. Do note you
can create a bull call spread with 2 options, for example - buy 2 ATM options and sell 2
OTM options.
Like other things in options trading, do consider the Greeks, Theta in particular!

I suppose this chapter has laid a foundation for understanding basic ‘spreads’. Going
forward I will assume you are familiar with what a moderately bullish/bearish move
would mean, hence I would probably start directly with the strategy notes.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. A moderate move would mean you expect a movement in the stock/index but the outlook
is not too aggressive
2. One has to quantify ‘moderate’ by evaluating the volatility of the stock/index
3. Bull Call spread is a basic spread that you can set up when the outlook is moderately
bullish
4. Classic bull call spread involves buying ATM option and selling OTM option – all
belonging to same expiry, same underlying, and equal quantity
5. The theta plays an important role in strike selection
6. The risk reward gets skewed based on the strikes you choose

CHAPTER 3

Bull Put Spread

3.1 – Why Bull Put Spread?
Similar to the Bull Call Spread, the Bull Put Spread is a two leg option strategy invoked
when the view on the market is ‘moderately bullish’. The Bull Put Spread is similar to
the Bull Call Spread in terms of the payoff structure; however there are a few differences
in terms of strategy execution and strike selection. The bull put spread involves creating
a spread by employing ‘Put options’ rather than ‘Call options’ (as is the case in bull call
spread).
You may have a fundamental question at this stage – when the payoffs from both Bull
call spread and Bull Put spread are similar, why should one choose a certain strategy
over the other?

Well, this really depends on how attractive the premiums are. While the Bull Call spread
is executed for a debit, the bull put spread is executed for a credit. So if you are at a
point in the market where –
1. The markets have declined considerably (therefore PUT premiums have swelled)
2. The volatility is on the higher side
3. There is plenty of time to expiry

And you have a moderately bullish outlook looking ahead, then it makes sense to invoke
a Bull Put Spread for a net credit as opposed to invoking a Bull Call Spread for a net
debit. Personally I do prefer strategies which offer net credit rather than strategies
which offer net debit.

3.2 – Strategy Notes
The bull put spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ITM and OTM
Put options. However you can create the spread using other strikes as well.
To implement the bull put spread –
1. Buy 1 OTM Put option (leg 1)
2. Sell 1 ITM Put option (leg 2)

When you do this ensure –
1. All strikes belong to the same underlying
2. Belong to the same expiry series
3. Each leg involves the same number of options

For example –
Date – 7th December 2015
Outlook – Moderately bullish (expect the market to go higher)
Nifty Spot – 7805
Bull Put Spread, trade set up -

zerodha.com/varsity

1. Buy 7700 PE by paying Rs.72/- as premium; do note this is an OTM option. Since
money is going out of my account this is a debit transaction
2. Sell 7900 PE and receive Rs.163/- as premium, do note this is an ITM option. Since I
receive money, this is a credit transaction
3. The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 163 – 72 = +91, since
this is a positive cashflow, there is a net credit to my account.

Generally speaking in a bull put spread there is always a ‘net credit’, hence the bull put
spread is also called referred to as a ‘Credit spread’.
After we initiate the trade, the market can move in any direction and expiry at any level.
Therefore let us take up a few scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bull
put spread for different levels of expiry.
Scenario 1 - Market expires at 7600 (below the lower strike price i.e OTM
option)
The value of the Put options at expiry depends upon its intrinsic value. If you recall from
the previous module, the intrinsic value of a put option upon expiry is –
Max [Strike-Spot, o]
In case of 7700 PE, the intrinsic value would be –
Max [7700 - 7600 – 0]
= Max [100, 0]
= 100
Since we are long on the 7700 PE by paying a premium of Rs.72, we would make
= Premium Paid – Intrinsic Value
= 100 – 72
= 28

zerodha.com/varsity

22

Likewise, in case of the 7900 PE option it has an intrinsic value of 300, but since we
have sold/written this option at Rs.163
Payoff from 7900 PE this would be –
163 - 300
= - 137
Overall strategy payoff would be –
+ 28 – 137
= - 109
Scenario 2 - Market expires at 7700 (at the lower strike price i.e the OTM
option)
The 7700 PE will not have any intrinsic value, hence we will lose all the premium that
we have paid i.e Rs.72.
The 7900 PE’s intrinsic value will be Rs.200.
Net Payoff from the strategy would be –
Premium received from selling 7900PE - Intrinsic value of 7900 PE – Premium lost on
7700 PE
= 163 – 200 – 72
= - 109
Scenario 3 - Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price, i.e ITM
option)
The intrinsic value of both 7700 PE and 7900 PE would be 0, hence both the potions
would expire worthless.
Net Payoff from the strategy would be –

zerodha.com/varsity

23

Premium received for 7900 PE - Premium Paid for 7700 PE
= 163 – 72
= + 91
Scenario 4 - Market expires at 8000 (above the higher strike price, i.e the
ITM option)
Both the options i.e 7700 PE and 7900 PE would expire worthless, hence the total
strategy payoff would be
Premium received for 7900 PE - Premium Paid for 7700 PE
= 163 – 72
= + 91
To summarize –
Market Expiry 7700 PE (intrinsic value) 7900 PE (intrinsic value) Net pay off

From this analysis, 3 things should be clear to you –
1. The strategy is profitable as and when the market moves higher
2. Irrespective of the down move in the market, the loss is restricted to Rs.109, the
maximum loss also happens to be the difference between “Spread and net credit’ of
the strategy
3. The maximum profit is capped to 91. This also happens to be the net credit of the
strategy.

We can define the ‘Spread’ as Spread = Difference between the higher and lower strike price

zerodha.com/varsity

24

We can calculate the overall profitability of the strategy for any given expiry value. Here
is screenshot of the calculations that I made on the excel sheet –



LS – IV --- Lower Strike - Intrinsic value (7700 PE, OTM)



PP --- Premium Paid



LS Payoff --- Lower Strike Payoff



HS-IV --- Higher strike - Intrinsic Value (7900 PE, ITM)



PR --- Premium Received



HS Payoff --- Higher Strike Payoff

As you can notice, the loss is restricted to Rs.109, and the profit is capped to Rs.91.
Given this, we can generalize the Bull Put Spread to identify the Max loss and Max profit
levels as Bull PUT Spread Max loss = Spread – Net Credit
Net Credit = Premium Received for higher strike – Premium Paid for lower strike
Bull Put Spread Max Profit = Net Credit
This is how the pay off diagram of the Bull Put Spread looks like –

zerodha.com/varsity

25

There are three important points to note from the payoff diagram –
1. The strategy makes a loss if Nifty expires below 7700. However the loss is restricted to
Rs.109.
2. The breakeven point (where the strategy neither make a profit or loss) is achieved when
the market expires at 7809. Therefore we can generalize the breakeven point for a Bull
Put spread as Higher Strike - Net Credit
3. The strategy makes money if the market moves above 7809, however the maximum
profit achievable is Rs.91 i.e the difference between the Premium Received for ITM PE
and the Premium Paid for the OTM PE
1. Premium Paid for 7700 PE = 72
2. Premium Received for 7900 PE = 163
3. Net Credit = 163 – 72 = 91

3.3 – Other Strike combinations
Remember the spread is defined as the difference between the two strike prices. The
Bull Put Spread is always created with 1 OTM Put and 1 ITM Put option, however the
strikes that you choose can be any OTM and any ITM strike. The further these strikes
are the larger the spread, the larger the spread the larger is possible reward.
Let us take some examples considering spot is at 7612 –

So the point here is that, you can create the spread with any combination of OTM and
ITM option. However based on the strikes that you choose (and therefore the spread you
create), the risk reward ratio changes. In general, if you have a high conviction on a
‘moderately bullish’ view then go ahead and create a larger spread; else stick to a smaller
spread.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. The Bull Put Spread is an alternative to the Bull Call Spread. Its best executed when the
outlook on the market is ‘moderately bullish’
2. Bull Put Spread results in a net credit
3. The Bull Put Spread is best executed when the market has cracked, put premiums are
high, the volatility is on the higher side, and you expect the market to hold up (without
cracking further)
4. The Bull Put strategy involves simultaneously buying a OTM Put option and selling a
ITM Put option
5. Maximum profit is limited to the extent of the net credit
6. Maximum loss is limited to the Spread minus Net credit
7. Breakeven is calculated as Higher Strike – Net Credit
8. One can create the spread by employing any OTM and ITM strikes
9. Higher the spread, higher the profit potential, and higher the breakeven point.

CHAPTER 4

Call Ratio Back Spread
4.1 – Background
The Call Ratio Back Spread is an interesting options strategy. I call this interesting
keeping in mind the simplicity of implementation and the kind of pay off it offers the
trader. This should certainly have a spot in your strategy arsenal. The strategy is
deployed when one is out rightly bullish on a stock (or index), unlike the bull call spread
or bull put spread where one is moderately bullish.
At a broad level this is what you will experience when you implement the Call Ratio Back
Spread1. Unlimited profit if the market goes up
2. Limited profit if market goes down
3. A predefined loss if the market stay within a range

In simpler words you can get to make money as long as the market moves in either
direction.

zerodha.com/varsity

29

Usually, the Call Ratio Back Spread is deployed for a ‘net credit’, meaning money flows
into your account as soon as you execute Call Ratio Back Spread. The ‘net credit’ is what
you make if the market goes down, as opposed to your expectation (i.e market going up).
On the other hand if the market indeed goes up, then you stand to make an unlimited
profit. I suppose this should also explain why the call ratio spread is better than buying a
plain vanilla call option.
So let’s go ahead and figure out how this works.

4.2 – Strategy Notes
The Call Ratio Back Spread is a 3 leg option strategy as it involves buying two
OTM call option and selling one ITM Call option. This is the classic 2:1 combo. In fact
the call ratio back spread has to be executed in the 2:1 ratio meaning 2 options bought
for every one option sold, or 4 options bought for every 2 option sold, so on and so forth.
Let take an example - assume Nifty Spot is at 7743 and you expect Nifty to hit 8100 by
the end of expiry. This is clearly a bullish outlook on the market. To implement the Call
Ratio Back Spread zerodha.com/varsity

30

1. Sell one lot of 7600 CE (ITM)
2. Buy two lots of 7800 CE (OTM)

Make sure –
1. The Call options belong to the same expiry
2. Belongs to the same underlying
3. The ratio is maintained

The trade set up looks like this –
1. 7600 CE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.201/2. 7800 CE, two lots long, the premium paid is Rs.78/- per lot, so Rs.156/- for 2 lots
3. Net Cash flow is = Premium Received – Premium Paid i.e 201 – 156 = 45 (Net Credit)

With these trades, the call ratio back spread is executed. Let us check what would
happen to the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.
Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry as the strategy
payoff is quite versatile.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7400 (below the lower strike price)
We know the intrinsic value of a call option (upon expiry) is –
Max [Spot – Strike, 0]
The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of
Max [7400 – 7600, 0]
=0
Since we have sold this option, we get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.201
The intrinsic value of 7800 call option would also be zero; hence we lose the total
premium paid i.e Rs.78 per lot or Rs.156 for two lots.
Net cash flow would Premium Received – Premium paid
zerodha.com/varsity

31

= 201 – 156
= 45
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7600 (at the lower strike price)
The intrinsic value of both the call options i.e 7600 and 7800 would be zero, hence both
of them expire worthless.
We get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.201 towards the 7600 CE however we lose
Rs.156 on the 7800 CE resulting in a net payoff of Rs.45.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7645 (at the lower strike price plus net
credit)
You must be wondering why I picked the 7645 level, well this is to showcase the fact that
the strategy break even is at this level.
The intrinsic value of 7600 CE would be –
Max [Spot – Strike, 0]
= [7645 – 7600, 0]
= 45
Since, we have sold this option for 201 the net pay off from the option would be
201 – 45
= 156
On the other hand we have bought two 7800 CE by paying a premium of 156. Clearly the
7800 CE would expire worthless hence, we lose the entire premium.
Net payoff would be –
156 – 156

zerodha.com/varsity

32

=0
So at 7645 the strategy neither makes money or loses any money for the trader, hence
7645 is treated as a breakeven point for this trade.
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7700 (half way between the lower and higher
strike price)
The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, and the 7800 would have no intrinsic
value.
On the 7600 CE we get to retain 101, as we would lose 100 from the premium received of
201 i.e 201 – 100 = 101.
We lose the entire premium of Rs.156 on the 7800 CE, hence the total payoff from the
strategy would be
= 101 – 156
= - 55
Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7800 (at the higher strike price)
This is an interesting market expiry level, think about it –
1. At 7800 the 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, and hence we have to let go of
the entire premium received i.e 201
2. At 7800, the 7800 CE would expire worthless hence we lose the entire premium paid for
the 7800 CE i.e Rs.78 per lot, since we have 2 of these we lose Rs.156

So this is like a ‘double whammy’ point for the strategy!
The net pay off for the strategy is –
Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE – Premium Paid for 7800
CE
= 201 – 200 - 156

zerodha.com/varsity

33

= -155
This also happens to be the maximum loss of this strategy.
Scenario 6 – Market expires at 7955 (higher strike i.e 7800 + Max loss)
I’ve deliberately selected this strike to showcase the fact that at 7955 the strategy
breakeven!
But we dealt with a breakeven earlier, you may ask?
Well, this strategy has two breakeven points – one on the lower side (7645) and another
one on the upper side i.e 7955.
At 7955 the net payoff from the strategy is –
Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE + (2* Intrinsic value of
7800 CE) – Premium Paid for 7800 CE
= 201 – 355 + (2*155) – 156
= 201 – 355 + 310 – 156
=0
Scenario 7 – Market expires at 8100 (higher than the higher strike price,
your expected target)
The 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 500, and the 7800 CE will have an intrinsic
value of 300.
The net payoff would be –
Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE + (2* Intrinsic value of
7800 CE) – Premium Paid for 7800 CE
= 201 – 500 + (2*300) – 156
= 201 – 500 + 600 -156

zerodha.com/varsity

34

= 145
Here are various other levels of expiry, and the eventual payoff from the strategy. Do
note, as the market goes up, so does the profits, but when the market goes down, you
still make some money, although limited.

4.3 – Strategy Generalization
Going by the above discussed scenarios we can make few generalizations –


Spread = Higher Strike – Lower Strike



Net Credit = Premium Received for lower strike – 2*Premium of higher strike



Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit



Max Loss occurs at = Higher Strike



The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit



Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit



Upper Breakeven = Higher Strike + Max Loss

Here is a graph that highlights all these important points –

zerodha.com/varsity

35

Notice how the payoff remains flat even when the market goes down, the maximum loss
at 7800, and the way the payoff takes off beyond 7955.

4.4 – Welcome back the Greeks
I suppose you are familiar with these graphs by now. The following graphs show the
profitability of the strategy considering the time to expiry and therefore these graphs
help the trader select the right strikes.

zerodha.com/varsity

36

Before understanding the graphs above, note the following –
1. Nifty spot is assumed to be at 8000
2. Start of the series is defined as anytime during the first 15 days of the series
3. End of the series is defined as anytime during the last 15 days of the series
4. The Call Ratio Back Spread is optimized and the spread is created with 300 points
difference

The thought here is that the market will move up by about 6.25% i.e from 8000 to 8500.
So considering the move and the time to expiry, the graphs above suggest –
1. Graph 1 (top left) and Graph 2 (top right) - You are at the start of the expiry series
and you expect the move over the next 5 days (and 15 days in case of Graph 2), then a
Call Ratio Spread with 7800 CE (ITM) and 8100 CE (OTM) is the most
profitable wherein you would sell 7800 CE and buy 2 8100 CE. Do note - even though

zerodha.com/varsity

37

you would be right on the direction of movement, selecting other far OTM strikes call
options tend to lose money
2. Graph 3 (bottom left) and Graph 4 (bottom right) - You are at the start of the
expiry series and you expect the move in 25 days (and expiry day in case of Graph 3),
then a Call Ratio Spread with 7800 CE (ITM) and 8100 CE (OTM) is the most profitable
wherein you would sell 7800 CE and buy 2 8100 CE.

You must be wondering that the selection of strikes is same irrespective of time to
expiry. Well yes, in fact this is the point – Call ratio back spread works best when you
sell slightly ITM option and buy slightly OTM option when there is ample time to
expiry. In fact all other combinations lose money, especially the ones with far OTM
options and especially when you expect the target to be achieved closer to the expiry.
Here are another bunch of charts; the only difference is that the move (i.e 6.25%) occurs
during the 2nd half of the series -

zerodha.com/varsity

38

1. Graph 1 (top left) & Graph 2 (top right) – If you expect the move during the 2nd half
of the series, and you expect the move to happen within a day (or within 5 days,
graph 2) then the best strikes to opt are deep ITM and slightly ITM i.e 7600 (lower
strike short) and 7900 (higher strike long). Do note, this is not the classic combo of an
ITM + OTM spread, instead this is an ITM and ITM spread! In fact all other
combinations don’t work.
2. Graph 3 (bottom right) & Graph 4 (bottom left) - If you expect the move during
the 2nd half of the series, and you expect the move to happen within 10 days (or on
expiry day, graph 4) then the best strikes to opt are deep ITM and slightly ITM i.e
7600 (lower strike short) and 7900 (higher strike long). This is similar to what graph 1
and graph 2 suggest.

Again, the point to note here is besides getting the direction right, the strike selection is
the key to the profitability of this strategy. One needs to be diligent enough to map the
time to expiry to the right strike to make sure that the strategy works in your favor.
What about the effect of volatility on this strategy? Well, volatility plays a key role here,
have a look at the image below –

zerodha.com/varsity

39

There are three colored lines depicting the change of “net premium” aka the strategy
payoff versus change in volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase
in volatility on the strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.
1. Blue Line – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample time to
expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Call ratio back spread. As we can see the strategy
payoff increases from -67 to +43 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%. Clearly
this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides being right on the direction
of stock/index you also need to have a view on volatility. For this reason, even though
I’m bullish on the stock, I would be a bit hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the
series if the volatility is on the higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility
reading)
2. Green line - This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are about 15
days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous case. As we can
see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the volatility increase from 15% to
30%.
3. Red line – This is an interesting, counter intuitive outcome. When there are very few
days to expiry, increase in volatility has a negative impact on the strategy! Think about it,
increase in volatility when there are few days to expiry enhances the possibility of the
option to expiry OTM, hence the premium decreases. So, if you are bullish on a stock /
index with few days to expiry, and you also expect the volatility to increase during this
period then thread cautiously.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. The Call Ratio Backspread is best executed when your outlook on the stock/index is
bullish
2. The strategy requires you to sell 1 ITM CE and buy 2 OTM CE, and this is to be executed
in the same ratio i.e for every 1 sold option, 2 options have to be purchased
3. The strategy is usually executed for a ‘net Credit’
4. The strategy makes limited money if the stock price goes down, and unlimited profit if
the stock price goes up. The loss is pre defined
5. There are two break even points – lower breakeven and upper breakeven points

zerodha.com/varsity

40

6. Spread = Higher Strike – Lower Strike
7. Net Credit = Premium Received for lower strike – 2*Premium of higher strike
8. Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit
9. Max Loss occurs at = Higher Strike
10. The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit
11. Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit
12. Upper Breakeven = Higher Strike + Max Loss
13. Irrespective of the time to expiry opt for slightly ITM + Slightly OTM combination of
strikes
14. Increase in volatility is good for this strategy when there is more time to expiry, but when
there is less time to expiry, increase in volatility is not really good for this strategy.

CHAPTER 5

Bear Call Ladder
5.1 – Background
The ‘Bear’ in the “Bear Call Ladder” should not deceive you to believe that this is a
bearish strategy. The Bear Call Ladder is an improvisation over the Call ratio back
spread; this clearly means you implement this strategy when you are out rightly bullish
on the stock/index.
In a Bear Call Ladder, the cost of purchasing call options is financed by selling an ‘in the
money’ call option. Further, the Bear Call Ladder is also usually setup for a ‘net credit’,
where the cash flow is invariably better than the cash flow of the call ratio back spread.
However, do note that both these strategies showcase similar payoff structures but differ
slightly in terms of the risk structure.

5.2 – Strategy Notes
The Bear Call Ladder is a 3 leg option strategy, usually setup for a “net credit”, and it
involves –
1. Selling 1 ITM call option
2. Buying 1 ATM call option
3. Buying 1 OTM call option

This is the classic Bear Call Ladder setup, executed in a 1:1:1 combination. The bear Call
Ladder has to be executed in the 1:1:1 ratio meaning for every 1 ITM Call option sold, 1
ATM and 1 OTM Call option has to be bought. Other combination like 2:2:2 or 3:3:3 (so
on and so forth) is possible.
Let’s take an example - assume Nifty Spot is at 7790 and you expect Nifty to hit 8100 by
the end of expiry. This is clearly a bullish outlook on the market. To implement the Bear
Call Ladder -

zerodha.com/varsity

43

1. Sell 1 ITM Call option
2. Buy 1 ATM Call option
3. Buy 1 OTM Call option

Make sure –
1. The Call options belong to the same expiry
2. Belongs to the same underlying
3. The ratio is maintained

The trade set up looks like this –
1. 7600 CE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.247/2. 7800 CE, one lot long, the premium paid for this option is Rs.117/3. 7900 CE, one lot long, the premium paid for this option is Rs.70/4. The net credit would be 247-117-70 = 60

With these trades, the bear call ladder is executed. Let us check what would happen to
the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.
Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry as the strategy
payoff is quite versatile.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7600 (below the lower strike price)
We know the intrinsic value of a call option (upon expiry) is –
Max [Spot – Strike, 0]
The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of
Max [7600 – 7600, 0]
=0
Since we have sold this option, we get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.247/Likewise the intrinsic value of 7800 CE and 7900 CE would also be zero; hence we lose
the premium paid i.e Rs.117 and Rs.70 respectively.

Net cash flow would Premium Received – Premium paid
= 247 – 117 - 70
= 60
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7660 (lower strike + net premium received)
The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of –
Max [Spot – Strike, 0]
The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of
Max [7660 – 7600, 0]
= 60
Since the 7600 CE is short, we will lose 60 from 247 and retain the balance
= 247 – 60
= 187
The 7800 and 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e 117
and 70 respectively.
The total strategy payoff would be = 187 – 117 – 70
=0
Hence at 7660, the strategy would neither make money nor lose money. Hence this is
considered a (lower) breakeven point.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7700 (between the breakeven point and
middle strike i.e 7660 and 7800)
The intrinsic value of 7600 CE would be –
zerodha.com/varsity

45

Max [Spot – Strike, 0]
= [7700 – 7600, 0]
= 100
Since, we have sold this option for 247 the net pay off from the option would be
247 – 100
= 147
On the other hand we have bought 7800 CE and 7900 CE, both of which would expire
worthless, hence we lose the premium paid for these options i.e 117 and 70 respectively Net payoff from the strategy would be –
147 – 117 – 70
= - 40
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7800 (at the middle strike price)
Pay attention here, as this is where the tragedy strikes!
The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, considering we have written this
option for a premium of Rs.247, we stand to lose the intrinsic value which is Rs.200.
Hence on the 7600 CE, we lose 200 and retain 247 – 200
= 47/Both 7800 CE and 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence the premium that we paid
goes waste, i.e 117 and 70 respectively. Hence our total payoff would be –
47 – 117 – 70
= -140
zerodha.com/varsity

46

Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price)
Pay attention again, tragedy strikes again
The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 300, considering we have written this
option for a premium of Rs.247, we stand to lose all the premium value plus more.
Hence on the 7600 CE, we lose 247 - 300
= -53
Both 7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, considering we have paid a
premium of Rs.117, the pay off for this option would be 100 – 117
= - 17
Finally 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence the premium paid i.e 70 would go waste.
The final strategy payoff would be –
-53 – 17 – 70
= -140
Do note, the loss at both 7800 and 7900 is the same.
Scenario 6 – Market expires at 8040 (sum of long strike minus short strike
minus net premium)
Similar to the call ratio back spread, the bear call ladder has two breakeven points i.e the
upper and lower breakeven. We evaluated the lower breakeven earlier (scenario 2), and
this is the upper breakeven point. The upper breakeven is estimated as –
(7900 + 7800) – 7600 – 60
= 15700 – 7600 - 60

zerodha.com/varsity

47

= 8100 – 60
= 8040
Do note, both 7900 and 7800 are strikes we are long on, and 7600 is the strike we are
short on. 60 is the net credit.
So at 8040, all the call options would have an intrinsic value –
7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7600 = 440, since we are short on this
at 247, we stand to lose 247 - 440 = -193.
7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7800 = 240, since we are long on this
at 117, we make 240 – 117 = +123
7900 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7900 = 140, since we are long on this
at 70, we make 140 – 70 = +70
Hence the total payoff from the Bear Call Ladder would be –
-193 + 123 + 70
=0
Hence at 8040, the strategy would neither make money nor lose money. Hence this is
considered a (upper) breakeven point.
Do note, at 7800 and 7900 the strategy was making a loss and at 8040 the strategy
broke even. This should give you a sense that beyond 8040, the strategy would make
money. Lets just validate this with another scenario.
Scenario 7 – Market expires at 8300
At 8300 all the call options would have an intrinsic value.
7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7600 = 700, since we are short on this
at 247, we stand to lose 247 - 700 = -453.

zerodha.com/varsity

48

7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7800 = 500, since we are long on this
at 117, we make 500 – 117 = +383
7900 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7900 = 400, since we are long on this
at 70, we make 400 - 70 = +330
Hence the total payoff from the Bear Call Ladder would be –
-453 + 383 + 330
= 260
As you can imagine, the higher the market move, the higher is the profit potential. Here
is a table that gives you the payoffs at various levels.

Do notice, when the market goes below you stand to make a modest gain of 60 points,
but when the market moves up the profits are uncapped.

5.3 – Strategy Generalization
Going by the above discussed scenarios we can make few generalizations –


Spread = technically this is a ladder and not really a spread. However the 1st two option
legs creates a classic “spread” wherein we sell ITM and buy ATM. Hence the spread could

zerodha.com/varsity

49

be taken as the difference between the ITM and ITM options. In this case it would be 200
(7800 – 7600)


Net Credit = Premium Received from ITM CE – Premium paid to ATM & OTM CE



Max Loss = Spread (difference between the ITM and ITM options) – Net Credit



Max Loss occurs at = ATM and OTM Strike



The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit



Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit



Upper Breakeven = Sum of Long strike minus short strike minus net premium

Here is a graph that highlights all these important points –

Notice how the strategy makes a loss between 7660 and 8040, but ends up making a
huge profit if the market moves past 8040. Even if the market goes down you still end
up making a modest profit. But you are badly hit if the market does not move at all.
Given this characteristics of the Bear Call Ladder, I would suggest you implement the
strategy only when you are absolutely sure that the market will move, irrespective of the
direction.
From my experience, I believe this strategy is best executed on stocks (rather than
index) when the quarterly results are due.

5.4 – Effect of Greeks
The effect of Greeks on this strategy is very similar to the effect of Greeks on Call Ratio
Back spread, especially the volatility bit. For your easy reference, I’m reproducing the
discussion on volatility we had in the previous chapter.

There are three colored lines depicting the change of “net premium” aka the strategy
payoff versus change in volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase
in volatility on the strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.
1. Blue Line – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample time to
expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Bear Call Ladder spread. As we can see the strategy
payoff increases from -67 to +43 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%. Clearly
this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides being right on the direction
of stock/index you also need to have a view on volatility. For this reason, even though
I’m bullish on the stock, I would be a bit hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the

zerodha.com/varsity

51

series if the volatility is on the higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility
reading)
2. Green line - This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are about 15
days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous case. As we can
see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the volatility increase from 15% to
30%.
3. Red line – This is an interesting, counter intuitive outcome. When there are very few
days to expiry, increase in volatility has a negative impact on the strategy! Think about it,
increase in volatility when there are few days to expiry enhances the possibility of the
option to expiry OTM, hence the premium decreases. So, if you are bullish on a stock /
index with few days to expiry, and you also expect the volatility to increase during this
period then thread cautiously.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. Bear Call Ladder is an improvisation over the Call Ratio Spread
2. Invariably the cost of executing a bear call ladder is better than the Call Ratio Spread, but
the range above which the market has to move also becomes large
3. The Bear Call Ladder is executed by selling 1 ITM CE, buying 1 ATM CE, and 1 OTM CE
4. Net Credit = Premium Received from ITM CE – Premium paid to ATM & OTM CE
5. Max Loss = Spread (difference between the ITM and ITM options) – Net Credit
6. Max Loss occurs at = ATM and OTM Strike
7. The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit
8. Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit
9. Upper Breakeven = Sum of Long strike minus short strike minus net premium
10. Execute the strategy only when you are convinced that the market will move significantly
higher.

CHAPTER 6

Synthetic Long & Arbitrage
6.1 – Background
Imagine a situation where you would be required to simultaneously establish a long and
short position on Nifty Futures, expiring in the same series. How would you do this and
more importantly why would you do this?
We will address both these questions in this chapter. To begin with let us understand
how this can be done and later move ahead to understand why one would want to do
this (if you are curious, arbitrage is the obvious answer).
Options as you may have realized by now, are highly versatile derivative instruments;
you can use these instruments to create any kind of payoff structure including that of the
futures (both long and short futures payoff).
In this chapter we will understand how we can artificially replicate a long futures pay off
using options. However before we proceed, you may want to just review the long
Future’s ‘linear’ payoff here
Alternatively, here is a quick overview –

zerodha.com/varsity

53

As you can see, the long futures position has been initiated at 2360, and at that point
you neither make money nor lose money, hence the point at which you initiate the
position becomes the breakeven point. You make a profit as the futures move higher
than the breakeven point and you make a loss the lower the futures move below the
breakeven point. The amount of profit you make for a 10 point up move is exactly the
same as the amount of loss you’d make for a 10 point down move. Because of this
linearity in payoff, the future is also called a linear instrument.
The idea with a Synthetic Long is to build a similar long Future’s payoff using options.

6.2 – Strategy Notes
Executing a Synthetic Long is fairly simple; all that one has to do is –
1. Buy the ATM Call Option
2. Sell the ATM Put Option

When you do this, you need to make sure –
1. The options belong to the same underlying
2. Belongs to the same expiry

zerodha.com/varsity

54

Let us take an example to understand this better. Assume Nifty is at 7389, which would
make 7400 the ATM strike. Synthetic Long would require us to go long on 7400 CE, the
premium for this is Rs.107 and we would short the 7400 PE at 80.
The net cash outflow would be the difference between the two premiums i.e 107 – 80
= 27.
Let us consider a few market expiry scenarios –
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200 (below ATM)
At 7200, the 7400 CE would expire worthless, hence we would lose the premium paid i.e
Rs.107/-. However the 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value, which can be calculated
as follows –
Intrinsic value of Put Option = Max [Strike-Spot, 0]
= Max [7400 – 7200, 0]
=Max [200, 0]
= 200.
Clearly, since we are short on this option, we would lose money from the premium we
have received. The loss would be –
80 – 200 = -120
Total payoff from the long Call and short Put position would be –
= -107 – 120
= -227
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7400 (At ATM)
If the market expires exactly at 7400, both the options would expire worthless and
hence –

zerodha.com/varsity

55

1. We lose the premium paid for the 7400 CE option i.e 107
2. We get the retain the premium for the 7400 PE option i.e 80
3. Net payoff from both the positions would be -27e 80 – 107

Do note, 27 also happens to be the net cash outflow of the strategy, which is also the
difference between the two premiums
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7427 (ATM + Difference between the two
premiums)
7427 is an interesting level, this is the breakeven point for the strategy, where we neither
make money nor lose money.
1. 7400 CE – the option is ITM and has an intrinsic value of 27. However we have paid 107
as premium hence we experience a total loss of 80
2. 7400 PE – the option would expire OTM, hence we get to retain the entire premium of
80.
3. On one hand we make 80 and the other we lose 80. Hence we neither make nor lose any
money, making 7427 the breakeven point for this strategy.

Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7600 (above ATM)
At 7600, the 7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, we would make Intrinsic value – Premium
= 200 – 107
= 93
The 7400 PE would expire worthless; hence we get to retain the entire premium of
Rs.80.
Total payoff from the strategy would be –
= 93 + 80
= 173

zerodha.com/varsity

56

With the above 4 scenarios, we can conclude that the strategy makes money while the
market moves higher and loses money while the market goes lower, similar to futures.
However this still does not necessarily mean that the payoff is similar to that of futures.
To establish that the synthetic long payoff behaves similar to futures, we need evaluate
the payoff of the strategy with reference to the breakeven point; let’s say 200 point
above and below the breakeven point. If the payoff is identical, then clearly there is
linearity in the payoff, similar to futures.
So let’s figure this out.
We know the breakeven point for this is –
ATM + difference between the premiums
= 7400 + 27
= 7427
The payoff around this point should be symmetric. We will consider 7427 + 200 =
7627 and 7427-200 = 7227 for this.
At 7627 –
1. The 7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 227, hence we get to make 227 – 107 = 120
2. The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to keep the entire premium of 80
3. In all we experience a payoff of 120 + 80 = 200

At 7227 –
1. The 7400 CE would not have any intrinsic value, hence we lose the entire premium paid
i.e 107
2. The 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value of 7400 – 7227 = 173, since we have received
80 as premium the net loss would be 80 – 173 = -93.
3. In all we experience a payoff of -93-107 = -200

Clearly, there is payoff symmetry around the breakeven, and for this reason,
the Synthetic Long mimics the payoff of the long futures instrument.

Further, here is the payoff at various expiry levels –

And when you plot the Net Payoff, we get the payoff structure which is similar to the
long call futures.

Having figured out how to set up a Synthetic long, we need to figure out the typical
circumstances under which setting up a synthetic long is required.

6.3 – The Fish market Arbitrage
I’ll assume that you have a basic understanding on Arbitrage. In easy words, arbitrage is
an opportunity to buy goods/asset in a cheaper market and sell the same in expensive
markets and pocket the difference in prices. If executed well, arbitrage trades are almost
risk free. Let me attempt to give you a simple example of an arbitrage opportunity.
Assume you live by a coastal city with abundant supply of fresh sea fish, hence the rate
at which fish is sold in your city is very low, let’s say Rs.100 per Kg. The neighboring city
which is 125 kms away has a huge demand for the same fresh sea fish. However, in this
neighboring city the same fish is sold at Rs.150 per Kg.
Given this if you can manage to buy the fish from your city at Rs.100 and manage to sell
the same in the neighboring city at Rs.150, then in process you clearly get to pocket the
price differential i.e Rs.50. Maybe you will have to account for transportation and other
logistics, and instead of Rs.50, you get to keep Rs.30/- per Kg. This is still a beautiful
deal and this is a typical arbitrage in the fish market!

zerodha.com/varsity

59

It looks perfect, think about it - if you can do this everyday i.e buy fish from your city at
Rs.100 and sell in the neighboring city at Rs.150, adjust Rs.20 towards expenses then
Rs.30 per KG is guaranteed risk free profit.
This is indeed risk free, provides nothing changes. But if things change, so will your
profitability, let me list few things that could change 1. No Fish (opportunity risk) – Assume one day you go to the market to buy fish at
Rs.100, and you realize there is no fish in the market. Then you have no opportunity to
make Rs.30/-.
2. No Buyers (liquidity risk) – You buy the fish at Rs.100 and go to the neighboring
town to sell the same at Rs.150, but you realize that there are no buyers. You are left
holding a bag full of dead fish, literally worthless!
3. Bad bargaining (execution risk) – The entire arbitrage opportunity hinges upon the
fact that you can ‘always’ bargain to buy at Rs.100 and sell at Rs.150. What if on a bad
day you happen to buy at 110 and sell at 140? You still have to pay 20 for transport, this
means instead of the regular 30 Rupees profit you get to make only 10 Rupees, and if this
continues, then the arbitrage opportunity would become less attractive and you may not
want to do this at all.
zerodha.com/varsity

60

4. Transport becomes expensive (cost of transaction) – This is another crucial
factor for the profitability of the arbitrage trade. Imagine if the cost of transportation
increases from Rs.20 to Rs.30? Clearly the arbitrage opportunity starts looking less
attractive as the cost of execution goes higher and higher. Cost of transaction is a critical
factor that makes or breaks an arbitrage opportunity
5. Competition kicks in (who can drop lower?) – Given that the world is inherently
competitive you are likely to attract some competition who would also like to make that
risk free Rs.30. Now imagine this –
a. So far you are the only one doing this trade i.e buy fish at Rs.100 and sell at
Rs.150
b. Your friend notices you are making a risk free profit, and he now wants to copy
you. You can’t really prevent his as this is a free market.
c. Both of you buy at Rs.100, transport it at Rs.20, and attempt to sell it in the
neighboring town
d. A potential buyer walks in, sees there is a new seller, selling the same quality of
fish. Who between the two of you is likely to sell the fish to the buyer?
e. Clearly given the fish is of the same quality the buyer will buy it from the one
selling the fish at a cheaper rate. Assume you want to acquire the client, and
therefore drop the price to Rs.145/f.

Next day your friend also drops the price, and offers to sell fish at Rs.140 per KG,
and therefore igniting a price war. In the whole process the price keeps dropping
and the arbitrage opportunity just evaporates.

g. How low can the price drop? Obviously it can drop to Rs.120 (cost of buying fish
plus transport). Beyond 120, it does not makes sense to run the business
h. Eventually in a perfectly competitive world, competition kicks in and arbitrage
opportunity just ceases to exist. In this case, the cost of fish in neighboring town
would drop to Rs.120 or a price point in that vicinity.

I hope the above discussion gave you a quick overview on arbitrage. In fact we can
define any arbitrage opportunity in terms of a simple mathematical expression, for
example with respect to the fish example, here is the mathematical equation –
[Cost of selling fish in town B - Cost of buying fish in town A] = 20
If there is an imbalance in the above equation, then we essentially have an arbitrage
opportunity. In all types of markets - fish market, agri market, currency market, and

zerodha.com/varsity

61

stock market such arbitrage opportunities exist and they are all governed by simple
arithmetic equations.

6.4 – The Options arbitrage
Arbitrage opportunities exist in almost every market, one needs to be a keen observer of
the market to spot it and profit from it. Typically stock market based arbitrage
opportunities allow you to lock in a certain profit (small but guaranteed) and carry this
profit irrespective of which direction the market moves. For this reason arbitrage trades
are quite a favorite with risk intolerant traders.
I would like to discuss a simple arbitrage case here, the roots of which lie in the concept
of ‘Put Call Parity’. I will skip discussing the Put Call Parity theory but would instead
jump to illustrate one of its applications.
However I’d suggest you watch this beautiful video from Khan Academy to understand
the Put Call Parity –
So based on Put Call Parity, here is an arbitrage equation –
Long Synthetic long + Short Futures = 0
You can elaborate this to –
Long ATM Call + Short ATM Put + Short Futures = 0
The equation states that the P&L upon expiry by virtue of holding a long synthetic long
and short future should be zero. Why should this position result in a zero P&L, well the
answer to this is attributable to the Put Call Parity.
However, if the P&L is a non zero value, then we have an arbitrage opportunity.
Here is an example that will help you understand this well.

zerodha.com/varsity

62

On 21st Jan, Nifty spot was at 7304, and the Nifty Futures was trading at 7316.

zerodha.com/varsity

63

The 7300 CE and PE (ATM options) were trading at 79.5 and 73.85 respectively. Do
note, all the contracts belong to the January 2016 series.
Going by the arbitrage equation stated above, if one were to execute the trade, the
positions would be –
1. Long 7300 CE @ 79.5
2. Short 7300 PE @ 73.85
3. Short Nifty futures @ 7316

Do note, the first two positions together form a long synthetic long. Now as per the
arbitrage equation, upon expiry the positions should result in a zero P&L. Let’s evaluate
if this holds true.
Scenario 1 – Expiry at 7200


The 7300 CE would expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e 79.5



The 7300 PE would have an intrinsic value of 100, but since we are short at 73.85, the
net payoff would be 73.85 – 100 = -26.15

zerodha.com/varsity

64



We are short on futures at 7316, which would result in a profit of 116 points (7316 –
7200)



Net payoff would be -79.5 – 26.15 + 116 = +10.35

Clearly, instead of a 0 payoff, we are experiencing a positive non zero P&L.
Scenario 2 – Expiry at 7300


The 7300 CE would expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e 79.5



The 7300 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to retain 73.85



We are short on futures at 7316, which would result in a profit of 16 points (7316 – 7300)



Net payoff would be -79.5 +73.85+16 = +10.35

Scenario 3 – Expiry at 7400


The 7300 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, and therefore the payoff would be 100
– 79.5 = 20.5



The 7300 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to retain 73.85



We are short on futures at 7316, which would result in loss of 84 points (7316 – 7400)



Net payoff would be 20.5 + 73.85 - 84 = +10.35

You could test this across any expiry value (in other words the markets can move in any
direction) but you are likely to pocket 10.35 points, upon expiry. I’d like to stress this
again; this arbitrage lets you make 10.35, upon expiry.
Here is the payoff structure at different expiry values –

zerodha.com/varsity

65

Interesting isn’t it? But what’s the catch you may ask?
Transaction charges!
One has to account for the cost of execution of this trade and figure out if it still makes
sense to take up the trade. Consider this –


Brokerage – if you are trading with a traditional broker, then you will be charged on a
percentage basis which will eat away your profits. So on one hand you make 10 points,
but you may end up paying 8 – 10 points as brokerage. However if you were to do this
trade with a discount broker like Zerodha, your breakeven on this trade would be around
4-5 points. This should give you more reason to open your account with Zerodha



STT – Do remember the P&L is realised upon expiry; hence you would have to carry
forward your positions to expiry. If you are long on an ITM option (which you will be)
then upon expiry you will have to pay a hefty STT, which will further eat away your
profits. Please do read this to know more.



Other applicable taxes – Besides you also have to account for service tax, stamp duty
etc

So considering these costs, the efforts to carry an arbitrage trade for 10 points may not
make sense. But it certainly would, if the payoff was something better, maybe like 15 or
zerodha.com/varsity

66

20 points. With 15 or 20 points you can even maneuver the STT trap by squaring off the
positions just before expiry - although it will shave off a few points.

Bear Put Spread
7.1 – Spreads versus naked positions
Over the last five chapters we’ve discussed various multi leg bullish strategies. These
strategies ranged to suit an assortment of market outlook - from an outrightly bullish
market outlook to moderately bullish market outlook. Reading through the last 5
chapters you must have realised that most professional options traders prefer initiating
a spread strategy versus taking on naked option positions. No doubt, spreads tend to
shrink the overall profitability, but at the same time spreads give you a greater visibility
on risk. Professional traders value ‘risk visibility’ more than the profits. In simple words,
it’s a much better deal to take on smaller profits as long as you know what would be your
maximum loss under worst case scenarios.
Another interesting aspect of spreads is that invariably there is some sort of financing
involved, wherein the purchase of an option is funded by the sale of another option. In
fact, financing is one of the key aspects that differentiate a spread versus a normal naked
directional position. Over the next few chapters we will discuss strategies which you can
deploy when your outlook ranges from moderately bearish to out rightly bearish. The
composition of these strategies is similar to the bullish strategies that we discussed
earlier in the module.
The first bearish strategy we will look into is the Bear Put Spread, which as you may
have guessed is the equivalent of the Bull Call Spread.

7.2 – Strategy notes
Similar to the Bull Call Spread, the Bear Put Spread is quite easy to implement. One
would implement a bear put spread when the market outlook is moderately bearish, i.e
you expect the market to go down in the near term while at the same time you don’t
expect it to go down much. If I were to quantify ‘moderately bearish’, a 4-5% correction
would be apt. By invoking a bear put spread one would make a modest gain if the
markets correct (go down) as expected but on the other hand if the markets were to go
up, the trader will end up with a limited loss.
A conservative trader (read as risk averse trader) would implement Bear Put Spread
strategy by simultaneously –
1. Buying an In the money Put option
2. Selling an Out of the Money Put option
There is no compulsion that the Bear Put Spread has to be created with an ITM and
OTM option. The Bear Put spread can be created employing any two put options. The
choice of strike depends on the aggressiveness of the trade. However do note that both
the options should belong to the same expiry and same underlying. To understand the
zerodha.com/varsity

70

implementation better, let’s take up an example and see how the strategy behaves under
different scenarios.
As of today Nifty is at 7485, this would make 7600 PE In the money and 7400 PE Out of
the money. The ‘Bear Put Spread’ would require one to sell 7400 PE, the premium
received from the sale would partially finance the purchase of the 7600 PE. The
premium paid (PP) for the 7600 PE is Rs.165, and the premium received (PR) for the
7400 PE is Rs.73/-. The net debit for this transaction would be –
73 – 165
= -92
To understand how the payoff of the strategy works under different expiry
circumstances, we need to consider different scenarios. Please do bear in mind the
payoff is upon expiry, which means to say that the trader is expected to hold these
positions till expiry.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7800 (above long put option i.e 7600)
This is a case where the market has gone up as opposed to the expectation that it would
go down. At 7800 both the put option i.e 7600 and 7400 would not have any intrinsic
value, hence they would expire worthless.





The premium paid for 7600 PE i.e Rs.165 would go to 0, hence we retain nothing
The premium received for 7400 PE i.e Rs.73 would be retained entirely
Hence at 7800, we would lose Rs.165 on one hand but this would be partially
offset by the premium received i.e Rs.73
The overall loss would be -165 + 73 = -92

Do note the ‘-ve’ sign associated with 165 indicates that this is a money outflow from the
account, and the ‘+ve’ sign associated with 73 indicates that the money is received into
the account.
Also, the net loss of 92 is equivalent to the net debit of the strategy.
Scenario 2 – Market expired at 7600 (at long put option)

zerodha.com/varsity

71

In this scenario we assume the market expires at 7600, where we have purchased a Put
option. But then, at 7600 both 7600 and 7400 PE would expire worthless (similar to
scenario 1) resulting in a loss of -92.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7508 (breakeven)
7508 is half way through 7600 and 7400, and as you may have guessed I’ve picked 7508
specifically to showcase that the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money at
this specific point.


The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7508, 0],
which is 92.



Since we have paid Rs.165 as premium for the 7600 PE, some of the premium
paid would be recovered. That would be 165 – 92 = 73, which means to say the
net loss on 7600 PE at this stage would be Rs.73 and not Rs.165
The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to retain the entire premium
of Rs.73
So on hand we make 73 (7400 PE) and on the other we lose 73 (7600 PE)
resulting in a no loss no profit situation




Hence, 7508 would be the breakeven point for this strategy.
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7400 (at short put option)
This is an interesting level, do recall when we initiated the position the spot was at 7485,
and now the market has gone down as expected. At this point both the options would
have interesting outcomes.


The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7400, 0],
which is 200



We have paid a premium of Rs.165, which would be recovered from the intrinsic
value of Rs.200, hence after compensating for the premium paid one would
retain Rs.35/The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence the entire premium of Rs.73 would
be retained
The net profit at this level would be 35+73 = 108




zerodha.com/varsity

72

The net payoff from the strategy is in line with the overall expectation from the strategy
i.e the trader gets to make a modest profit when the market goes down.
Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7200 (below the short put option)
This is again an interesting level as both the options would have an intrinsic value. Lets
figure out how the numbers add up –


The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7200, 0],
which is 400



We have paid a premium of Rs.165, which would be recovered from the intrinsic
value of Rs.400, hence after compensating for the premium paid one would





retain Rs.235/The 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7400 -7200, 0],
which is 200
We received a premium of Rs.73, however we will have to let go of the premium
and bear a loss over and above 73. This would be 200 -73 = 127
On one hand we make a profit of Rs.235 and on the other we lose 127, therefore
the net payoff of the strategy would be 235 – 127 = 108.

Summarizing all the scenarios (I’ve put up the payoff values directly after considering
the premiums)

Do note, the net payoff from the strategy is in line with the overall expectation from the
strategy i.e the trader gets to make a modest profit when the market goes down while at
the same time the losses are capped in case the market goes up.
Have a look at the table below -

zerodha.com/varsity

73

The table below shows the strategy payoff at different expiry levels. The losses are
capped to 92 (when markets go up) and the profits are capped to 108 (when markets go
down).

7.3 – Strategy critical levels
From the above discussed scenarios we can generalize a few things –
1. Strategy makes a loss if the spot moves above the breakeven point, and makes a
profit below the breakeven point
2. Both the profits and loss are capped
3. Spread is difference between the two strike prices.
a. In this example spread would be 7600 – 7400 = 200
4. Net Debit = Premium Paid – Premium Received
a. 165 – 73 = 92
5. Breakeven = Higher strike – Net Debit
a. 7600 – 92 = 7508
6. Max profit = Spread – Net Debit
a. 200 – 92 = 108
7. Max Loss = Net Debit
a. 92

zerodha.com/varsity

74

You can note all these critical points in the strategy payoff diagram -

7.4 – Quick note on Delta
This is something I missed talking about in the earlier chapters, but its better late than
never :-). Whenever you implement an options strategy always add up the deltas. I used
the B&S calculator to calculate the deltas.
The delta of 7600 PE is -0.618

The delta of 7400 PE is – 0.342
zerodha.com/varsity

75

The negative sign indicates that the put option premium will go down if the markets go
up, and premium gains value if the markets go down. But do note, we have written the
7400 PE, hence the Delta would be
-(-0.342)
+ 0.342
Now, since deltas are additive in nature we can add up the deltas to give the combined
delta of the position. In this case it would be –
-0.618 + (+0.342)
= - 0.276
This means the strategy has an overall delta of 0.276 and the ‘–ve’ indicates that the
premiums will go up if the markets go down. Similarly you can add up the deltas of
other strategies we’ve discussed earlier - Bull Call Spread, Call Ratio Back spread etc and
you will realize they all have a positive delta indicating that the strategy is bullish.
When you have more than 2 option legs it gets really difficult to estimate the overall bias
of the strategy (whether the strategy is bullish or bearish), in such cases you can quickly
add up the deltas to know the bias. Further, if in case the deltas add to zero, then it

zerodha.com/varsity

76

means that the strategy is not really biased to any direction. Such strategies are called
‘Delta Neutral’. We will eventually discuss these strategies at a later point in this
module.
Also, you may be interested to know that while the delta neutral strategies are immune
to market’s directional move, they react to changes in volatility and time, hence these
are also sometime called “Volatility based strategies”.

7.5 – Strike selection and effect of volatility
The strike selection for a bear put spread is very similar to the strike selection
methodology of a bull call spread. I hope you are familiar with the ‘1st half of the series’
and ‘2nd half of the series’ methodology. If not I’d suggest you to kindly read
through section 2.3.
Have a look at the graph below –

If we are in the first half of the series (ample time to expiry) and we expect the market to
go down by about 4% from present levels, choose the following strikes to create the
spread

We will now shift our focus on the effect of volatility on the bear put spread. Have a look
at the following image –

The graph above explains how the premium varies with respect to variation in volatility
and time.




The blue line suggests that the cost of the strategy does not vary much with the
increase in volatility when there is ample time to expiry (30 days)
The green line suggests that the cost of the strategy varies moderately with the
increase in volatility when there is about 15 days to expiry
The red line suggests that the cost of the strategy varies significantly with the
increase in volatility when there is about 5 days to expiry

From these graphs it is clear that one should not really be worried about the changes in
the volatility when there is ample time to expiry. However one should have a view on
volatility between midway and expiry of the series. It is advisable to take the bear put
spread only when the volatility is expected to increase, alternatively if you expect the
volatility to decrease, its best to avoid the strategy.

CHAPTER 8

Bear Call Spread
8.1 – Choosing Calls over Puts
Similar to the Bear Put Spread, the Bear Call Spread is a two leg option strategy invoked
when the view on the market is ‘moderately bearish’. The Bear Call Spread is similar to
the Bear Put Spread in terms of the payoff structure; however there are a few differences
in terms of strategy execution and strike selection. The Bear Call spread involves
creating a spread by employing ‘Call options’ rather than ‘Put options’ (as is the case in
bear put spread).
You may have a fundamental question at this stage – when the payoffs from both Bear
Put spread and Bear Call spread are similar, why should one choose a Bear Call spread
over a Bear Put spread?

zerodha.com/varsity

81

Well, this really depends on how attractive the premiums are. While the Bear Put spread
is executed for a debit, the Bear Call spread is executed for a credit. So if you are at a
point in the market where –
1. The markets have rallied considerably (therefore CALL premiums have swelled)
2. The volatility is favorable
3. Ample time to expiry
And you have a moderately bearish outlook going forward, then it makes sense to invoke
a Bear Call Spread for a net credit as opposed to invoking a Bear Put Spread for a net
debit. Personally I do prefer strategies which offer net credit rather than strategies
which offer net debit.

8.2 – Strategy Notes
The Bear Call Spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ITM and OTM
Call options. However you can create the spread using other strikes as well. Do
remember, the higher the difference between the two selected strikes (spread), larger is
the profit potential.
To implement the bear call spread –
1. Buy 1 OTM Call option (leg 1)
2. Sell 1 ITM Call option (leg 2)
Ensure –
1. All strikes belong to the same underlying
2. Belong to the same expiry series
3. Each leg involves the same number of options
Let us take up example to understand this better Date – February 2016
Outlook – Moderately bearish
Nifty Spot – 7222

zerodha.com/varsity

82

Bear Call Spread, trade set up 1. Buy 7400 CE by paying Rs.38/- as premium; do note this is an OTM option.
Since money is going out of my account this is a debit transaction
2. Sell 7100 CE and receive Rs.136/- as premium, do note this is an ITM option.
Since I receive money, this is a credit transaction
3. The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 136 – 38
= +98, since this is a positive cashflow, there is a net credit to my account.
Generally speaking in a bear call spread there is always a ‘net credit’, hence the bear call
spread is also called referred to as a ‘credit spread’. After we initiate the trade, the
market can move in any direction and expiry at any level. Therefore let us take up a few
scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bear put spread for different levels
of expiry.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7500 (above the long Call)
At 7500, both the Call options would have an intrinsic value and hence they both would
expire in the money.




7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, since we have paid a premium of
Rs.38, we would be in a profit of 100 – 38 = 62
7100 CE would have an intrinsic value of 400, since we have sold this option at
Ra.136, we would incur a loss of 400 – 136 = -264
Net loss would be -264 + 62 = - 202

Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7400 (at the long call)
At 7400, the 7100 CE would have an intrinsic value and hence would expire in the
money. The 7400 CE would expire worthless.




7400 CE would expire worthless, hence the entire premium of Rs.38 would be
written of as a loss.
7100 CE would have an intrinsic value of 300, since we have sold this option at
Ra.136, we would incur a loss of 300 – 136 = -164
Net loss would be -164 -38 = - 202

zerodha.com/varsity

83

Do note, the loss at 7400 is similar to the loss at 7500 pointing to the fact that above a
certain point loss is capped to 202.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7198 (breakeven)
At 7198, the trade neither makes money or losses money, hence this is considered a
breakeven point. Let us see how the numbers play out here –





At 7198, the 7100CE would expire with an intrinsic value of 98. Since we have
sold the option at Rs.136, we get to retain a portion of the premium i.e 136 – 98
= +38
7400 CE would expire worthless, hence we will lose the premium paid i.e 38
Net payoff would -38 + 38 = 0

This clearly indicates that the strategy neither makes money or losses money at 7198.
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7100 (at the short call)
At 7100, both the Call options would expire worthless, hence it would be out of the
money.




7400 would not have any value, hence the premium paid would be a complete
loss, i.e Rs.38
7100 will also not have any intrinsic value, hence the entire premium received i.e
Rs.136 would be retained back
Net profit would be 136 - 38 = 98

Clearly, as and when the market falls, the strategy makes a profit.
Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7000 (below the short call)
This scenario tests the profitability of the strategy when the market falls further. At
7000, both the call options would expire worthless. While we treat the premium paid for
7400 CE i.e Rs.38 as a loss , we will retain the entire premium received for 7100 CE i.e
Rs.136 as a profit. Hence the net profit from the strategy would be 136-38 = 98. Clearly,
as and when the market falls, the strategy tends to make money, but it is capped to
Rs.98.

zerodha.com/varsity

84

Here is the payoff for the strategy at different expiries –

These payoffs can be plotted to get the graph of the strategy payoff –

As you can observe, the payoff is similar to a bear put spread where both the profits
under best case scenario and losses under worst case scenario is pre defined.

8.3 – Strategy Generalization
zerodha.com/varsity

85

Going by the above payoff we can generalize the key trigger points for the strategy –






Spread = Difference between the strikes
o 7400 – 7100 = 300
Net Credit = Premium Received – Premium Paid
o 136 – 38 = 98
Breakeven = Lower strike + Net Credit
o 7100 + 98 = 7198
Max Profit = Net Credit
Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit
o 300 – 98 = 202

At this stage, we can add up the Deltas to get the overall position delta to know the
strategy’s sensitivity to the directional movement.
From the BS calculator I got the Delta values as follows –





7400 CE is OTM option and has a delta of +0.32
7100 CE is ITM option and has a delta of +0.89
Since we are short 7100 CE, the delta is –(+0.89) = -0.89
Overall position delta is = +0.32 + (-0.89) = -0.57

The delta of the strategy is negative, and it indicates that the strategy makes money
when the underlying goes down, and makes a loss when the underlying goes up.

8.4 – Strike Selection and impact of Volatility
The following images help us identify the best call option strikes to choose, given the
time to expiry. We have discussed the split up of time frame (1st and 2nd half of the
series) several times before, hence for this reason I will just post the graphs and the
summary table.

CHAPTER 9

Put Ratio Back Spread
9.1 – Background
We discussed the “Call Ratio Back spread” strategy extensively in chapter 4 of this
module. The Put ratio back spread is similar except that the trader invokes this when he
is bearish on the market or stock.
At a broad level this is what you will experience when you implement the Put Ratio Back
Spread
1. Unlimited profit if the market goes down
2. Limited profit if market goes up
3. A predefined loss if the market stays within a range
In simpler words you make money as long as the market moves in either direction, of
course the strategy is more favorable if market goes down.

zerodha.com/varsity

91

Usually, the Put Ratio Back Spread is deployed for a ‘net credit’, meaning money flows
into your account as soon as you execute Put Ratio Back Spread. The ‘net credit’ is what
you make if the market goes up, as opposed to your expectation (i.e market going down).
On the other hand if the market indeed goes down, then you stand to make an unlimited
profit.
I suppose this should also explain why the put ratio back spread is better than buying a
plain vanilla put option.

9.2 – Strategy Notes
The Put Ratio Back Spread is a 3 leg option strategy as it involves buying two
OTM Put options and selling one ITM Put option. This is the classic 2:1 combo. In
fact the put ratio back spread has to be executed in the 2:1 ratio meaning 2 options
bought for every one option sold, or 3 options bought for every 2 options sold, so on and
so forth.

zerodha.com/varsity

92

Let take an example - Nifty Spot is at 7506 and you expect Nifty to hit 7000 by the end
of expiry. This is clearly a bearish expectation. To implement the Put Ratio Back Spread
1. Sell one lot of 7500 PE (ITM)
2. Buy two lots of 7200 PE (OTM)
Make sure –
1. The Put options belong to the same expiry
2. Belong to the same underlying
3. The ratio is maintained
The trade set up looks like this –
1. 7500 PE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.134/2. 7200 PE, two lots long, the premium paid is Rs.46/- per lot, so Rs.92/- for 2 lots
3. Net Cash flow is = Premium Received – Premium Paid i.e 134 – 92 = 42 (Net
Credit)
With these trades, the Put ratio back spread is executed. Let us check what would
happen to the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.
Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry, as the
strategy payoff is quite versatile.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7600 (above the ITM option)
At 7600, both the Put options would expire worthless. The intrinsic value of options and
the eventual strategy payoff is as below –




7200 PE, would expire worthless, since we are long 2 lots of this option at Rs.46
per lot, we would lose the entire premium of Rs.92 paid
7500 PE would also expire worthless, but we have written this option and
received a premium of Rs.134, which in this case can be retained back
The net payoff from the strategy is 134 – 92 = 42

zerodha.com/varsity

93

Do note, the net payoff of the strategy at 7600 (higher than the ITM strike) is equivalent
to the net credit.
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7500 (at the higher strike i.e the ITM option)
At 7500 both the options would have no intrinsic value, hence they both would expire
worthless. Hence the payoff would be similar to the payoff we discussed at 7600. Hence
the net strategy payoff would be equal to Rs.42 (net credit).
In fact as you may have guessed, the payoff of the strategy at any point above 7500 is
equal to the net credit.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7458 (higher break even)
Like in the call ratio back spread strategy, the put ratio back spread too has two
breakeven points i.e the upper breakeven and the lower breakeven point. 7458 marks
the upper breakeven level; of course we will discuss how we arrived at the upper
breakeven point a little later in the chapter.






At 7458, the 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value. As you may recall, the put
option intrinsic value can be calculated as Max[Strike – Spot, 0] i.e Max[7500 –
7458, 0] hence 42
Since we have sold 7500 PE at 134, we will lose a portion of the premium received
and retain the rest. Hence the payoff would be 134 – 42 = 92
The 7200 PE will not have any intrinsic value, hence the entire premium paid i.e
92 is lost
So on one hand we made 92 on the 7500 PE and on the other we would lose 92
on the 7200 PE resulting in no loss, no gain. Thus, 7458 marks as one of the
breakeven points.

Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7200 (Point of maximum pain)
This is the point at which the strategy causes maximum pain, let us figure out why.


At 7200, 7500 PE would have an intrinsic value of 300 (7500 – 7200). Since we
have sold this option and received a premium of Rs.134, we would lose the entire
premium received and more. The payoff on this would be 134 - 300 = - 166





7200 PE would expire worthless as it has no intrinsic value. Hence the entire
premium paid of Rs.92 would be lost
The net strategy payoff would be -166 – 92 = - 258
This is a point where both the options would turn against us, hence is considered
as the point of maximum pain

Scenario 5 – Market expires at 6942 (lower break even)
At 6942, both the options would have an intrinsic value; however this is the lower
breakeven point. Let’s figure out how this works –





At 6942, 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value equivalent of 7500 – 6942 = 558.
Since have sold this option at 134, the payoff would be 134 – 558 = - 424
The 7200 PE will also have an intrinsic value equivalent of 7200 – 6942 = 258
per lot, since we are long two lots the intrinsic value adds upto 516. We have
initially paid a premium of Rs.92 (both lots included), hence this needs to be
deducted to arrive at the payoff would be 516 – 92 = +424
So on one hand we make 424 on the 7200 PE and on the other we would lose 424
on the 7500 PE resulting in no loss, no gain. Thus, 6942 marks as one of the
breakeven points.

Scenario 6 – Market expires at 6800 (below the lower strike price)
Remember, the put ratio backspread is a bearish strategy. It is supposed to make money
once the market goes below the lower breakeven point. So lets understand how the pay
off behaves at a point lower than the lower breakeven point.



At 6800, 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value of 700 and since we are short
7500PE at 134, we would lose 134 -700 = - 566
7200 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. Since we are long 2 lots, the intrinsic



value would be 800. Premium paid for two lots is Rs.92, hence after adjusting for
the premium paid, we get to make 800 – 92 = +708
Net strategy payoff would be 708 – 566 = +142

Likewise, you can evaluate the strategy payoff at different levels of market expiry and
you will realize that the profits are uncapped as long as the market continues to slide.
The following table showcases the same –

Plotting the different payoff points, gives us the strategy payoff graph –

Clearly from the graph above, we can conclude –
1. If markets go down, then the profits are unlimited

zerodha.com/varsity

96

2. There are two breakeven points
3. The point at which maximum loss occurs is at 7200
4. If markets goes up, then the profits are limited

9.3 – Strategy generalization
We can generalize the key strategy levels as below –
1. Spread = Higher Strike – lower strike
a. 7500 – 7200 = 300
2. Max loss = Spread – Net credit
a. 300 – 42 = 258
3. Max Loss occurs at = Lower strike price
4. Lower Breakeven point = Lower strike – Max loss
a. 7200 – 258 = 6942
5. Upper breakeven point = Lower strike + Max loss
a. 7200 + 258 = 7458

9.4 – Delta, strike selection, and effect of volatility
As we know, the strategy gets more profitable as and when the market falls. In other
words this is a directional strategy (profitable when markets go down) and therefore the
delta at overall strategy level should reflect this. Let us do the math to figure this out –


7500 PE is ITM option, delta is - 0.55. However since we have written the option,
the delta is –(-0.55) = +0.55



7200 PE is OTM, has a delta of - 0.29, remember we are long two lots here
The overall position delta would be +0.55 + (-0.29) +(-0.29) = - 0.03



The non zero Delta value clearly indicates that the strategy is sensitive to the directional
movement (although negligible). The negative sign indicates that the strategy makes
money when the market goes down.
As far as the strikes are concerned, I’d suggest you stick to the classic combination of
ITM and OTM options. Remember the trade needs to be executed for a ‘Net Credit’. Do
not initiate this strategy if there is a net outflow of cash at the time of execution.

zerodha.com/varsity

97

Let’s look at the variation in volatility and its effect on the strategy –

There are three colored lines depicting the change of “premium value” versus change in
volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase in volatility on the
strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.
1. Blue Line – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample
time to expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Put ratio back spread. As we can see
the strategy payoff increases from -57 to +10 when the volatility increase from
15% to 30%. Clearly this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides
being right on the direction of stock/index you also need to have a view on
volatility. For this reason, even though I’m bearish on the stock, I would be a bit
hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the series if the volatility is on the
higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility reading)
2. Green line - This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are
about 15 days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous
case. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the
volatility increase from 15% to 30%.

zerodha.com/varsity

98

3. Red line – Clearly increase in volatility when we have a few days to expiry does
not have much impact on the premium value. This means, when you are close to
expiry you only need to worry about the directional movement and need not
really worry much about the variation in volatility.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. The Put Ratio Back spread is best executed when your outlook on the stock/index
is bearish
2. The strategy requires you to sell 1 ITM PE and buy 2 OTM PE, and this is to be
executed in the same ratio i.e for every 1 option sold, 2 options have to be
purchased
3. The strategy is usually executed for a ‘Net Credit’
4. The strategy makes limited money if the stock price goes up, and unlimited profit
when the stock price goes down
5. There are two break even points – lower breakeven and upper breakeven
6. Spread = Higher Strike – Lower Strike
7. Net Credit = Premium Received for Higher strike – 2*Premium paid for lower
strike
8. Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit
9. Max Loss occurs at = Lower Strike
10. The payoff when market goes up = Net Credit
11. Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike – Max Loss
12. Upper Breakeven = Lower Strike + Max Loss
13. Irrespective of the time to expiry opt for ITM and OTM strike combination
14. Increase in volatility is good for this strategy when there is more time to expiry

CHAPTER 10

The Long Straddle
10.1 – The directional dilemma
How many times have you been in a situation wherein you take a trade after much
conviction, either long or short and right after you initiate the trade the market moves
just the other way round? All your strategy, planning, efforts, and capital go for a toss.
I’m certain this is one situation all of us have been in. In fact this is one of the reasons
why most professional traders go beyond the regular directional bets and set up
strategies which are insulated against the unpredictable market direction. Strategies
whose profitability does not really depend on the market direction are called “Market
Neutral” or “Delta Neutral” strategies. Over the next few chapters we will understand
some of the market neutral strategies and how a regular retail trader can execute such
strategies. Let us begin with a ‘Long Straddle’.

zerodha.com/varsity

100

10.2 – Long Straddle
Long straddle is perhaps the simplest market neutral strategy to implement. Once
implemented, the P&L is not affected by the direction in which the market moves. The
market can move in any direction, but it has to move. As long as the market moves
(irrespective of its direction), a positive P&L is generated. To implement a long straddle
all one has to do is –
1. Buy a Call option
2. Buy a Put option
Ensure –
1. Both the options belong to the same underlying
2. Both the options belong to the same expiry
3. Belong to the same strike
Here is an example which explains the execution of a long straddle and the eventual
strategy payoff. As I write this, the market is trading at 7579, which would make the
strike 7600 ‘At the money’. Long straddle would require us to simultaneously purchase

zerodha.com/varsity

101

the ATM call and put options.As you can see from the snapshot above, 7600CE is
trading at 77 and 7600 PE is trading at 88. The simultaneous purchase of both these
options would result in a net debit of Rs.165. The idea here is – the trader is long on
both the call and put options belonging to the ATM strike. Hence the trader is not really
worried about which direction the market would move. If the market goes up, the trader
would expect to see gains in Call options far higher than the loss made (read premium
paid) on the put option. Similarly, if the market goes down, the gains in the Put option
far exceeds the loss on the call option. Hence irrespective of the direction, the gain in
one option is good enough to offset the loss in the other and still yield a positive P&L.
Hence the market direction here is meaningless. Let us break this down further and
evaluate different expiry scenarios. Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200, put
option makes money This is a scenario where the gain in the put option not only
offsets the loss made in the call option but also yields a positive P&L over and above. At
7200 –




7600 CE will expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e Rs. 77
7600 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. After adjusting for the premium paid
i.e Rs.88, we get to retain 400 – 88 = 312
The net payoff would be 312 – 77 = + 235

As you can see, the gain in put option after adjusting for the premium paid for put
option and after adjusting for the premium paid for the call option still yields a positive
P&L. Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7435 (lower breakeven) This is a situation
where the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money.




7600 CE would expire worthless; hence the premium paid has to be written off.
Loss would be Rs.77
7600 PE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence this is the gain in the put
option
However the net premium paid for the call and put option is Rs.165, which gets
adjusted with the gain in the put option

If you think about it, with respect to the ATM strike, market has indeed expired at a
lesser value. So therefore the put option makes money. However, the gains made in the
put option adjusts itself against the premium paid for both the call and put option,
eventually leaving no money on the table. Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7600 (at

zerodha.com/varsity

102

the ATM strike) At 7600, the situation is quite straight forward as both the call and
put option would expire worthless and hence the premium paid would be gone. The loss
here would be equivalent to the net premium paid i.e Rs.165. Scenario 4 – Market
expires at 7765 (upper breakeven) This is similar to the 2nd scenario we discussed.
This is a point at which the strategy breaks even at a point higher than the ATM strike.




7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence this is the gain in Call option
7600 PE would expire worthless, hence the premium paid towards the option is
lost
The gain made in the 7600 CE is offset against the combined premium paid

Hence the strategy would breakeven at this point. Scenario 5 – Market expires at
8000, call option makes money Clearly the market in this scenario is way above the
7600 ATM mark. The call option premiums would swell, so much so that the gains in
call option will more than offset the premiums paid. Let us check the numbers –




7600 PE will expire worthless, hence the premium paid i.e Rs.88 is to be written
off
At 8000, the 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 400
The net payoff here is 400 – 88 – 77 = +235

zerodha.com/varsity

103

So as you can see, the gain in call option is significant enough to offset the combined
premiums paid. Here is the payoff table at different market expiry levels.As you can
observe –
1. The maximum loss (165) occurs at 7600, which is the ATM strike
2. The profits are unlimited in either direction of the market

zerodha.com/varsity

104

We can visualize these points in the payoff structure here –

From
the V shaped payoff graph, the following things are quite clear –
1. With reference to the ATM strike, the strategy makes money in either direction
2. Maximum loss is experienced when markets don’t move and stay at ATM
a. Max loss = Net premium paid
3. There are two breakevens – on either side, equidistant from ATM
a. Upper Breakeven = ATM + Net premium
b. Lower Breakeven = ATM – Net premium
I’m certain, you find this strategy quite straight forward to understand and implement.
In summary, you buy calls and puts, each leg has a limited down side, hence the
combined position also has a limited downside and an unlimited profit potential. So in
essence, a long straddle is like placing a bet on the price action each-way - you make
money if the market goes up or down. Hence the direction does not matter here. But let
me ask you this – if the direction does not matter, what else matters for this strategy?

10.3 – Volatility Matters
Yes, volatility matters quite a bit when you implement the straddle. I would not be
exaggerating if I said that volatility makes or breaks the straddle. Hence a fair

zerodha.com/varsity

105

assessment on volatility serves as the backbone for the straddle’s success. Have a look at
this graph below –The y-axis represents the cost of the strategy, which is simply the

combined premium of both the options and the x-axis represents volatility. The blue,
green, and red line represents how the premium increases when the volatility increases
given that there is 30, 15, and 5 days to expiry respectively. As you can see, this is a
linear graph and irrespective of time to expiry, the strategy cost increases as and when
the volatility increases. Likewise the strategy costs decreases when the volatility
decreases. Have a look at the blue line; it suggests when volatility is 15%, the cost of
setting up a long straddle is 160. Remember the cost of a long straddle represents the
combined premium required to buy both call and put options. So at 15% volatility it
costs Rs.160 to set up the long straddle, however keeping all else equal, when volatility
increases to 30% it costs Rs.340 to set up the same long straddle. In other words, you
are likely to double your money in the straddle provided –
1. You set up the long straddle at the start of the month
2. The volatility at the time of setting up the long straddle is relatively low
3. After you set up the long straddle, the volatility doubles
You can make similar observations with the green and red line which represents the
‘price to volatility’ behavior when the time to expiry is 15 and 5 days respectively. Now,
this also means you will lose money if you execute the straddle when the volatility is
zerodha.com/varsity

106

high which starts to decline after you execute the long straddle. This is an extremely
crucial point to remember. At this point, let us have a quick discussion on the
overall strategy’s delta. Since we are long on ATM strike, the delta of both the options is
close to 0.5.



The call option has a delta of + 0.5
The put option has a delta of - 0.5

The delta of call option offsets the delta of put option thereby resulting in a net ‘0’
overall delta. Recall, delta shows the direction bias of the position. A +ve delta indicates
a bullish bias and a -ve delta indicates a bearish bias. Given this, a 0 delta indicates that
there is no bias whatsoever to the direction of the market. So all strategies which have
zero deltas are called ‘Delta Neutral’ and Delta Neutral strategies are insulated against
the market direction.

10.4 – What can go wrong with the straddle?
On the face of it a long straddle looks great. Think about it – you get to make money
whichever way the market decides to move. All you need is the right volatility estimate.
Therefore, what can really go wrong with a straddle? Well, two things come in between
you and the profitability of a long straddle –
1. Theta Decay – All else equal, options are depreciating assets and this
particularly hurts long positions. The closer you get to expiration, the lesser time
value of the option. Time decay accelerates exponentially during the last week
before expiration, so you do not want to hold onto out-of-the-money or at-themoney options into the last week and lose premiums rapidly.
2. Large breakevens – Recollect, in the example we discussed earlier, the
breakeven points were 165 points away from the ATM strike. The lower
breakeven point was 7435 and the upper breakeven was 7765, considering the
ATM strike was 7600. In percentage terms, the market has to move 2.2% (either
ways) to achieve breakeven. This means that from the time you initiate the
straddle, the market or the stock has to move atleast 2.2% either ways for you to
start making money…and this move has to happen within a maximum of 30 days.
Further if you want to make a profit of atleast 1% on this trade, then we are
talking about a 1% move over and above 2.2% on the index. Such large move on

zerodha.com/varsity

107

the index is quite a challenge in my opinion and I will explain why in the next
chapter.
Keeping the above two points plus the impact on volatility in perspective, we can
summarize what really needs to work in your favor for the straddle to be profitable 1. The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution
2. The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy
3. The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not
matter
4. The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the
expiry
From my experience trading long straddles, they are profitable when setup around
major market events and the impact of such events should exceed over and above what
the market expects. Let me explain the ‘event and expectation’ part a bit more, please do
read the following carefully. Let us take the Infosys results as an example here. Event Quarterly results of Infosys Expectation – ‘Muted to flat’ revenue guideline for the
coming few quarters. Actual Outcome – As expected Infosys announces ‘muted to flat’
revenue guideline for the coming few quarters. If you were the set up a long straddle in
the backdrop of such an event (and its expectation), and eventually the expectation is
matched, then chances are that the straddle would fall apart. This is because around
major events, volatility tends to increase which tends to drive the premium high. So if
you are to buy ATM call and put options just around the corner of an event, then you are
essentially buying options when the volatility is high. When events are announced and
the outcome is known, the volatility drops like a ball, and therefore the premiums. This
naturally breaks the straddle down and the trader would lose money owing to the
‘bought at high volatility and sold at low volatility’ phenomena. I’ve noticed this
happening over and over again, and unfortunately have seen many traders lose money
exactly for this reason. Favorable Outcome – However imagine, instead of ‘muted to
flat’ guideline they announce an ‘aggressive’ guideline. This would essentially take the
market by surprise and drive premiums much higher, resulting in a profitable straddle
trade. This means there is another angle to straddles – your assessment of the event’s
outcome should be couple of notches better than the general market’s assessment. You
cannot setup a straddle with a mediocre assessment of events and its outcome. This may
seem like a difficult proposition but you will have to trust me here – few quality years of

zerodha.com/varsity

108

trading experience will actually get you to assess situations way better than the rest of
the market. So, just for clarity, I’d like to repost all the angles which need to be aligned
for the straddle to be profitable –
1. The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution
2. The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy
3. The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not
matter
4. The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the
expiry
5. Long straddles are to be set around major events, and the outcome of these
events to be drastically different from the general market expectation.
You may be wondering there are far too many points that come in between you and the
long straddle’s profitability. But worry not, I’ll share an antidote in the next chapter –
The Short Straddle, and why it makes sense. Download the long straddle excel.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. Strategies which are insulated to market direction are called ‘Market Neutral’ or
‘Delta neutral’
2. Market neutral strategies such as long straddle makes money either which way
the market moves
3. Long straddle requires you to simultaneously buy the ATM Call and Put option.
The options should belong to the same underlying, same strike, and same expiry
4. By buying the CE and PE – the trader is placing the bet on either direction
5. The maximum loss is equal to the net premium paid, and it occurs at the strike at
which the long straddle has been initiated
6. The upper breakeven is ‘strike + net premium’. The lower breakeven is ‘strike –
net premium’
7. The deltas in a long straddle adds up to zero

CHAPTER 11

The Short Straddle
11.1 – Context
In the previous chapter we understood that for the long straddle to be profitable, we
need a set of things to work in our favor, reposting the same for your quick reference –
1. The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution
2. The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy
3. The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not
matter
4. The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the
expiry
5. Long straddles are to be setup around major events, and the outcome of these
events to be drastically different from the general market expectation.
Agreed that the directional movement of the market does not matter in the long
straddle, but the bargain here is quite hard. Considering the 5 points list, getting the
long straddle to work in you favor is quite a challenge. Do recall, in the previous chapter
the breakdown was at 2%, add to this another 1% as desired profits and we are
essentially looking for, at least a 3% move on the index. From my experience expecting
the market to make such moves regularly is quite a challenge. In fact for this reason
alone, I think twice each and every time I need to initiate a long straddle.
I have witnessed many traders recklessly set up long straddles thinking they are
insulated to the market’s directional movement. But in reality they end up losing money
in a long straddle – time delay and the general movement in the market (or the lack of
it) works against them. Please note, I’m not trying to discourage you from employing the
long straddle, no one denies the simplicity and elegance of a long straddle. It works
extremely well when all the 5 points above are aligned. My only issue with long straddle
is the probability of these 5 points aligning with each other.

zerodha.com/varsity

111

Now think about this – there are quite a few factors which prevents the long straddle to
be profitable. So as an extension of this – the same set of factors ‘should’ favor the
opposite of a long straddle, i.e the ‘Short Straddle’.

11.2 – The Short Straddle
Although many traders fear the short straddle (as losses are uncapped), I personally
prefer trading the short straddle on certain occasions over its peer strategies. Anyway let
us quickly understand the set up of a short straddle, and how its P&L behaves across
various scenarios.
Setting up a short straddle is quite straight forward – as opposed to buying the ATM Call
and Put options (like in long straddle) you just have to sell the ATM Call and Put option.
Obviously the short strategy is set up for a net credit, as when you sell the ATM options,
you receive the premium in your account.
Here is any example, consider Nifty is at 7589, so this would make the 7600 strike ATM.
The option premiums are as follows –

zerodha.com/varsity

112




7600 CE is trading at 77
7600 PE is trading at 88

So the short straddle will require us to sell both these options and collect the net
premium of 77 + 88 = 165.
Please do note – the options should belong to the same underlying, same expiry, and of
course same strike. So assuming you have executed this short straddle, let’s figure out
the P&L at various market expiry scenarios.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200 (we lose money on put option)
This is a scenario where the loss in the put option is so large that it eats away the
premium collected by both the CE and PE, resulting in an overall loss. At 7200 –




7600 CE will expire worthless, hence we get the retain the premium received
i.e 77
7600 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. After adjusting for the premium
received i.e Rs.88, we lose 400 – 88 = - 312
The net loss would be 312 – 77 = - 235

As you can see, the gain in call option is offset by the loss in the put option.
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7435 (lower breakdown)
This is a situation where the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money.




7600 CE would expire worthless; hence the premium received is retained. Profit
here is Rs.77
7600 PE would have an intrinsic value of 165, out of which we have received
Rs.88 as premium, hence our loss would be 165 – 88 = -77
The gain in the call option is completely offset by the loss in the put option.
Hence we neither make money nor lose money at 7435.

Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7600 (at the ATM strike, maximum profit)
This is the most favorable outcome for a short straddle. At 7600, the situation is quite
straight forward as both the call and put option would expire worthless and hence the
zerodha.com/varsity

113

premium received from both the call and put option will be retained. The gain here
would be equivalent to the net premium received i.e Rs.165.
So this means, in a short straddle you make maximum money when the markets don’t
move!
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7765 (upper breakdown)
This is similar to the 2nd scenario we discussed. This is a point at which the strategy
breaks even at a point higher than the ATM strike.




7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence after adjusting for the
premium received of Rs. 77, we stand to lose Rs.88 (165 – 77)
7600 PE would expire worthless, hence the premium received i.e Rs.88 is
retained
The gain made in the 7600 PE is offset against the loss on the 7600 CE, hence we
neither make money nor lose money.

Clearly this is the upper breakdown point.
Scenario 5 – Market expires at 8000 (we lose money on call option)
Clearly the market in this scenario is way above the 7600 ATM mark. The call option
premium would swell, so would the loss –




7600 PE will expire worthless, hence the premium received i.e Rs.88 is retained
At 8000, the 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 400, hence after adjusting
for the premium received of Rs. 77, we stand to lose Rs. 323( 400 -77)
We have received Rs.88 as premium for the Put option, therefore the loss would
be 88- 323 = -235

So as you can see, the loss in the call option is significant enough to offset the combined
premiums received.
Here is the payoff table at different market expiry levels.

As you can observe –
1. The maximum profit 165 occurs at 7600, which is the ATM strike
2. The strategy remains profitable only between the lower and higher breakdown
numbers
3. The losses are unlimited in either direction of the market
We can visualize these points in the payoff structure here –

From the inverted V shaped payoff graph, the following things are quite clear –

zerodha.com/varsity

115

1. The point at which you can experience maximum profits is at ATM, the profits
shrink as you move away from the ATM mark
2. The strategy is profitable as long as the market stays within the breakdown points
3. Maximum loss is experienced when markets move further away from the
breakdown point. The further away the market moves from the breakdown point,
higher the loss
a. Max loss = Unlimited
4. There are two breakdown points – on either side, equidistant from ATM
a. Upper Breakdown = ATM + Net premium
b. Lower Breakdown = ATM – Net premium

116

As you may have realized by now, the short straddle works exactly opposite to the long
straddle. Short straddle works best when markets are expected to be in a range and not
really expected to make a large move.
Many traders fear short straddle considering the fact that short straddles have unlimited
losses on either side. However from my experience, short straddles work really well if
you know how exactly to deploy this. In fact in the last chapter of the previous module, I
had posted a case study involving short straddle. Probably that was one of the best
examples of when to implement the short straddle.
I will repost the same again here and I hope you will be able to appreciate the case study
better.

11.3 – Case Study (repost from previous module)
The following case study was a part of Module 5, Chapter 23. I’m reposting the same
here as I assume you would appreciate the example better at this stage. To get the
complete context, I’d request you to read the chapter.
Infosys was expected to announce their Q2 results on 12th October. The idea was simple
– news drives volatility up, so short options with an expectation that you can buy it back
when the volatility cools off. The trade was well planned and the position was initiated
on 8th Oct - 4 days prior to the event.
Infosys was trading close to Rs.1142/- per share, so he decided to go ahead with the 1140
strike (ATM).
Here is the snapshot at the time of initiating the trade -

zerodha.com/varsity

117

On 8th October around 10:35 AM the 1140 CE was trading at 48/- and the implied
volatility was at 40.26%. The 1140 PE was trading at 47/- and the implied volatility was
at 48%. The combined premium received was 95 per lot.
Market’s expectation was that Infosys would announce fairly decent set of numbers. In
fact the numbers were better than expected, here are the details “For the July-September quarter, Infosys posted a net profit of $519 million, compared
with $511 million in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped 8.7 % to $2.39 billion. On a
sequential basis, revenue grew 6%, comfortably eclipsing market expectations of 4- 4.5%
growth.
In rupee terms, net profit rose 9.8% to Rs.3398 crore on revenue of Rs. 15,635 crore,
which was up 17.2% from last year”. Source: Economic Times.

zerodha.com/varsity

118

The announcement came in around 9:18 AM, 3 minutes after the market opened, and
this trader did manage to close the trade around the same time.
Here is the snapshot -

The 1140 CE was trading at 55/- and the implied volatility had dropped to 28%. The
1140 PE was trading at 20/- and the implied volatility had dropped to 40%.
Do pay attention to this - the speed at which the call option shot up was
lesser than the speed at which the Put option dropped its value. The
combined premium was 75 per lot, and he made a 20 point profit per lot.

zerodha.com/varsity

119

11.4 – The Greeks
Since we are dealing with ATM options, the delta of both CE and PE would be around
0.5. We could add the deltas of each option and get a sense of how the overall position
deltas behave.




7600 CE Delta @ 0.5, since we are short, the delta would be -0.5
7600 PE Delta @ - 0.5, since we are short, the delta would be + 0.5
Combined delta would be -0.5 + 0.5 = 0

The combined delta indicates that the strategy is directional neutral. Remember both
long and short straddle is delta neutral. In case of long straddle, delta neutral suggests
that the profits are uncapped and in case of short straddle, the losses are uncapped.
Now here is something for you to think about – When you initiate a straddle you are
obviously delta neutral. But as the markets move, will your position still remain delta
neutral? If yes, why do you think so? If no, then is there a way to keep the position delta
neutral?
If you can build your thoughts around these points, then I can guarantee you that your
options knowledge is far greater than 90% of the market participants. To answer these
simple questions, you will need to step a little deeper and get into 2nd level of thinking.
Do post your comments below.
You can download the Short straddle excel.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. Short straddle requires you to simultaneously Sell the ATM Call and Put option.
The options should belong to the same underlying, same strike, and same expiry
2. By selling the CE and PE – the trader is placing the bet that the market wont
move and would essentially stay in a range
3. The maximum profit is equal to the net premium paid, and it occurs at the strike
at which the long straddle has been initiated

zerodha.com/varsity

120

4. The upper breakdown is ‘strike + net premium’. The lower breakdown is ‘strike –
net premium’
5. The deltas in a short straddle adds up to zero
6. The volatility should be relatively high at the time of strategy execution
7. The volatility should decrease during the holding period of the strategy
8. Short straddles can be set around major events, wherein before the event, the
volatility would drive the premiums up and just after the announcement, the
volatility would cool off, and so would the premiums.

CHAPTER 12

The Long & Short Straddle
12.1 – Background
If you have understood the straddle, then understanding the ‘Strangle’ is quite
straightforward. For all practical purposes, the thought process behind the straddle and
strangle is quite similar. Strangle is an improvisation over the straddle, mainly to reduce
the cost of implementation. Let me explain this further.
Consider this – Nifty is trading at 5921, which would make 5900 the ATM strike. If you
were to set up the long straddle here, you would be required to buy the 5900 CE and
5900 PE. The premiums for both these options are 66 and 57 respectively.
Net cash outlay = 66 + 57 = 123
Upper breakeven = 5921+123 = 6044
Lower breakeven = 5921 – 123 = 5798
Therefore to set up a straddle, you spend 123 and the breakeven on either side is 2.07%
away. As you know the straddle is delta neutral, meaning the strategy is insulated to the
directional movement of the market. The idea here is that you know that the market will
move to a large extent, but the direction is unknown.
Consider this – from your research you know that the market will move (direction
unknown) hence you have set up the straddle. However the straddle requires you to
make an upfront payment of 123.
How would it be if you were to set up a market neutral strategy - similar to the straddle,
but at a much lower cost?
Well, the ‘Strangle’ does just that.

zerodha.com/varsity

122

12.2 – Strategy Notes
The strangle is an improvisation over the straddle. The improvisation mainly helps in
terms of reduction of the strategy cost, however as a tradeoff the points required to
breakeven increases.
In a straddle you are required to buy call and put options of the ATM strike. However
the strangle requires you to buy OTM call and put options. Remember when compared
to the ATM strike, the OTM will always trade cheap, therefore this implies setting up a
strangle is cheaper than setting up a straddle.
Let’s take an example to explain this better –
Nifty is trading at 7921, to set up a strangle we need to buy OTM Call and Put options.
Do note, both the options should belong to the same expiry and same underlying. Also
the execution should happen in the same ratio (missed this point while discussing
straddle).

zerodha.com/varsity

123

Same ratio here means – one should buy the same number of call option as that of put
option. For instance it can be 1:1 ratio meaning 1 lot of call, 1 lot of put option. Or it can
be 5:5, meaning buy 5 lots of call and 5 lots of put option. Something like 2:3 is not
considered strangle (or straddle) as in this case you would be buying 2 lots of call
options and 3 lots of put options.
Going back to the example, considering Nifty is at 5921, we need to buy OTM Call and
Put options. I’d prefer to buy strikes which are 200 points either way (note, there is no
particular reason for choosing strikes 200 points away). So this would mean I would buy
7700 Put option and 8100 Call option. These options are trading at 28 and 32
respectively.
The combined premium paid to execute the ‘strangle’ is 60. Let’s figure out how the
strategies behave under various scenarios. I’ll keep this discussion brief as I do believe
you are now comfortable accessing the P&L across various market scenarios.
Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7500 (much below the PE strike)
At 7500, the premium paid for the call option i.e. 32 will go worthless. However the put
option will have an intrinsic value of 200 points. The premium paid for the Put option is
28, hence the total profit from the put option will be 200 – 28 = +172
We can further deduct for the premium paid for call option i.e. 32 from the profits of Put
option and arrive at the overall profitability i.e. 172 – 32 = +140
Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7640 (lower breakeven)
At 7640, the 7700 put option will have an intrinsic value of 60. The put option’s intrinsic
value offsets the combined premium paid towards both the call and put option i.e.
32+28 = 60. Hence at 7640, the strangle neither makes money nor losses money.
Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7700 (at PE strike)
At 7700, both the call and put options would expire worthless, hence we would lose the
entire premium paid i.e. 32 + 28 = 60. Do note, this also happens to be the maximum
loss the strategy would suffer.
Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7900, 8100 (ATM and CE strike respectively)
zerodha.com/varsity

124

Both the options expire worthless at 7900 and 8100. Hence we would lose the entire
premium paid i.e. 60.
Scenarios 5 – Market expires at 8160 (upper breakeven)
At 8160, the 8100 Call option has an intrinsic value of 60, the gains in the call option
would offset the loss incurred against the premium paid towards the call and put
options.
Scenarios 6 – Market expires at 8300 (much higher than the CE strike)
Clearly at 8300, the 8100 call option would have an intrinsic value of 200 points;
therefore the option would make 200 points. After adjusting for the combined premium
paid of 60 points, we would be left with 140 points profit. Notice the symmetry of payoff
above the upper and below the lower breakeven points.
Here is a table which contains various other market expiry scenarios and the eventual
payoff at these expiry levels –

We can plot the strategy payoff to visualize the payoff diagram of the strangle –

zerodha.com/varsity

125

We can generalize a few things about the ‘Strangle’ –
1. The maximum loss is restricted to the net premium paid
2. The loss would be maximum between the two strike prices
3. Upper Breakeven point = CE strike + net premium paid
4. Lower Breakeven point = PE strike – net premium paid
5. Profit potentially is unlimited
So as long as the market moves (irrespective of the direction) the profits are expected to
follow.

12.3 – Delta and Vega
Both straddles and strangles are similar strategies, therefore the Greeks have a similar
effect on strangle and straddles.
Since we are dealing with OTM options (remember we chose strikes that are equidistant
from ATM), the delta of both CE and PE would be around 0.3, or lesser. We could add
the deltas of each option and get a sense of how the overall position deltas behave.




7700 PE Delta @ - 0.3
8100 CE Delta @ + 0.3
Combined delta would be -0.3 + 0.3 = 0

zerodha.com/varsity

126

Of course, I’ve just assumed 0.3 for both the options for convenience; however both the
deltas could be slightly different, hence we could not be delta neutral in a strict sense.
But then the deltas will certainly not be too high such that it renders a directional bias
on the strategy. Anyway, the combined delta indicates that the strategy is directional
neutral.
The volatility has similar effect on both straddles and strangles. I’d suggest you
refer Chapter 10, section 10.3 to get a sense of how the volatility impacts the
strangles.
To summarize the effect of Greeks on strangles 1. The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution
2. The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy
3. The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not
matter
4. The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the
expiry
5. Long strangle is to be setup around major events, and the outcome of these
events have to be drastically different from the general market expectation
I suppose you understand why long strangles have to be set up around major market
events; we have discussed this point earlier as well. If you are confused, I’d request you
to read Chapter 10.

12.4 – Short Strangle
The execution of a short strangle is the exact opposite of the long strangle. One needs to
sell OTM Call and Put options which are equidistant from the ATM strike. In fact you
would short the ‘strangle’ for the exact opposite reasons as to why you go long strangle. I
will skip discussing the different expiry scenarios as I assume you are fairly comfortable
with establishing the payoff by now.
I’ve used the same strikes (the one used in long strangle example) for the short strangle
example. Instead of buying these options, you would sell these OTM options to set up a
short strangle. Here is the payoff table of the short strangle –

zerodha.com/varsity

127

As you can notice, the strategy results in a loss as and when the market moves in any
particular direction. However the strategy remains profitable between the lower and
upper breakeven points. Recall –




Upper breakeven point is at 8160
Lower breakeven point is at 7640
Max profit is net premium received, which is 60 points

In other words you get to take home 60 points as long as the market stays within 7640
and 8160. In my opinion this is a fantastic proposition. More often than not market
stays within certain trading ranges and therefore the market presents such beautiful
trading opportunities.
So here is something for you to think about – identify stocks which are in a trading
range, typically stocks in a trading range form double/triple tops and bottom. Setup the
‘strangle’ by writing strikes which are outside the upper and lower range. When you
write strangles in this backdrop make sure you watch closely for breakouts or
breakdowns.
I remember setting up this trade over and over again in Reliance couple of years ago Reliance was stuck between 850 and 1000 for the longest time.

128

Anyway, here is the payoff graph of the short strangle –

As you can notice –
1. The payoff of the short strangle looks exactly opposite of the long strangle
2. The profits are restricted to the extent of the net premium received
3. The profits are maximum as long as the stock stays within the two strike prices
4. The losses are potentially unlimited
The breakeven point calculation is the same as the breakeven points of a long strangle,
which we have discussed earlier.
You can download the long and short strangle excel here.

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. The strangle is an improvisation over the straddle, the improvisation helps in the
strategy cost reduction
2. Strangles are delta neutral and is insulated against any directional risk
3. To set up a long strangle one needs to buy OTM Call and Put option
4. The maximum loss in a long strangle is restricted to the extent of the premium
received
5. The profit potential is virtually unlimited in the long strangle
zerodha.com/varsity

6. The short strangle is the exact opposite of the long strangle. You are required to
sell the OTM call and put option in a short strangle
7. The Greeks have the same effect on strangles and straddles

CHAPTER 13

Max Pain & PCR
13.1 – My experience with Option Pain theory
In the never ending list of controversial market theories, the theory of ‘Option Pain’
certainly finds a spot. Option Pain, or sometimes referred to as ‘Max Pain’ has a
significant fan following and probably an equal number of people who despise it. I’ll be
honest; I’ve been in both camps! In the initial days of following Option Pain, I was never
able to make money consistently. However, overtime I found methods to improvise on
this theory to suit my own risk appetite, and that yielded a decent result. Later in the
chapter I will discuss this as well.
Anyway, now this is my attempt to present you the Option Pain theory and talk to you
about what I like and what I don’t about Max Pain. You can take cues from this chapter
and decide for yourself which camp you want to be in.
Option Pain theory requires you to be familiar with the concept of ‘Open Interest’.
So, let’s get started.

13.2 – Max Pain Theory
The origins of Option Pain dates back to 2004. So, in a sense, this is still a very young
theory. As far as I know there are no academic/scholastic papers on it, which makes one
wonder why the academia has ignored this concept.
The theory of options pain stems as a corollary to the belief - “90% of the options expire
worthless, hence option writers/sellers tend to make money more often, more
consistently than the option buyers”.
Now if this statement is true, then we can make a bunch of logical deductions -

zerodha.com/varsity

131

1. At any point only one party can make money i.e either the option buyers or
option sellers, but not both. From the above statement, it is clear that the sellers
are the ones making money.
2. If option sellers tend to make maximum money, then it also means that the price
of the option on expiry day should be driven to a point where it would cause least
amount of loss to option writers.
3. If point 2 is true, then it further implies that option prices can be manipulated, at
least on the day of expiry.
4. If point 3 is true, then it further implies that there exists a group of traders who
can manipulate the option prices, at least on the day of expiry.
5. If such a group exists then it must be the option writers/sellers since it is believed
that they are the ones who make maximum money/consistently make money
trading options.
Now considering all the above points, there must exist a single price point at which, if
the market expires, then it would cause least amount of pain to the option writers (or
cause maximum amount of pain to option buyers).
If one can identify this price point, then it’s most likely that this is the point at which
markets will expire. The ‘Option Pain’ theory does just this – identify the price at which
the market is likely to expire considering least amount of pain is caused to option
writers.

zerodha.com/varsity

132

Here is how optionspain.com formally defines Option Pain – “In the options market,
wealth transfer between option buyers and sellers is a zero sum game. On option
expiration days, the underlying stock price often moves toward a point that brings
maximum loss to option buyers. This specific price, calculated based on all outstanding
options in the markets, is called Option Pain. Option Pain is a proxy for the stock price
manipulation target by the option selling group”.

13.3 – Max Pain Calculation
Here is a step by step guide to calculate the Max Pain value. At this stage, you may find
this a bit confusing, but I recommend you read through it all the same. Things ill get
clearer once we take up an example –
Step 1 – List down the various strikes on the exchange and note down the open interest
of both calls and puts for these strikes.
Step 2 – For each of the strike price that you have noted, assume that the market
expires at that strike.

zerodha.com/varsity

133

Step 3 – Calculate how much money is lost by option writers (both call option and put
option writers) assuming the market expires as per the assumption in step 2.
Step 4 – Add up the money lost by call and put option writers.
Step 5 – Identify the strike at which the money lost by option writers is least.
This level, at which least amount of money is lost by option writers is the point at which
maximum pain is caused to option buyers. Therefore this is the price at which the
market is most likely to expire.
Let us take up a very simple example to understand this. For the sake of this example,
I’ll assume there are only 3 Nifty strikes available in the market. I have made a note of
the open interest for both call and put options for the respective strike.
Strike Call Option OI Put option OI
7700
7800
7900

1823400
3448575
5367450

5783025
4864125
2559375

Scenario 1 – Assume markets expires at 7700
Remember when you write a Call option, you will lose money only if the market moves
above the strike. Likewise, when you write a Put option you will lose money only when
the market moves below the strike price.
Therefore if the market expires at 7700, none of the call option writers will lose money.
Which means call option writers of 7700, 7800, and 7900 strikes will retain the
premiums received.
However, the put option writers will be in trouble. Let’s start with the 7900 PE writers –
At 7700 expiry, 7900 PE writers would lose 200 points. Since the OI is 2559375, the
Rupee value of loss would be –
= 200 * 2559375 = Rs.5,11,875,000/7800 PE writers would lose 100 points, the Rupee value would be

zerodha.com/varsity

134

= 100 * 4864125 = Rs.4,864,125,000/7700 PE writers will not lose any money.
So the combined money lost by option writers if the markets expire at 7700 would be –
Total money lost by Call Option writers + Total money lost by Put Option writers
= 0 + Rs.511875000 + 4,864125000 = Rs.9,98,287,500/Keep in mind that total money lost by Call Option writers = money lost by 7700 CE
writer + money lost by 7800 CE + money lost by 7900 CE
Likewise the Total money lost by Put Option writers = money lost by 7700 PE writer +
money lost by 7800 PE + money lost by 7900 PE
Scenario 2 – Assume markets expires at 7800
At 7800, the following call option writers would lose money –
7700 CE writers would lose 100 points, multiplying with its Open Interest we get the
Rupee value of the loss.
100*1823400 = Rs.1,82,340,000/Both 7800 CE and 7900 CE seller would not lose money.
The 7700 and 7800 PE seller wouldn't lose money
The 7900 PE would lose 100 points, multiplying with the Open Interest, we get the
Rupee value of the loss.
100*2559375 = Rs.2,55,937,500/So the combined loss for Options writers when market expires at 7800 would be –
= 182340000 + 255937500
= Rs.4,38,277,500/-

zerodha.com/varsity

135

Scenario 3 – Assume markets expires at 7900
At 7900, the following call option writers would lose money –
7700 CE writer would lose 200 points, the Rupee value of this loss would be –
200 *1823400 = Rs.3,646,800,000/7800 CE writer would lose 100 points, the Rupee value of this loss would be –
100*3448575 = Rs.3,44,857,500/7900 CE writers would retain the premiums received.
Since market expires at 7900, all the put option writers would retain the premiums
received.
So therefore the combined loss of option writers would be –
= 3646800000 + 344857500 = Rs. 7,095,375,000/So at this stage, we have calculated the total Rupee value loss for option writers at every
possible expiry level. Let me tabulated the same for you –
Strike Call Option OI Put option OI Loss value of calls Loss value of Puts
7700
7800
7900

1823400
3448575
5367450

5783025
4864125
2559375

0
182340000
7095375000

998287500
255937500
0

Total loss
998287500
438277500
7095375000

Now that we have identified the combined loss the option writers would experience at
various expiry level, we can easily identify the point at which the market is likely to
expire.
As per the option pain theory, the market will expire at such a point where there is least
amount of pain (read it as least amount of loss) to Option sellers.
Clearly, from the table above, this point happens to be 7800, where the combined loss is
around 438277500 or about 43.82 Crores, which is much lesser compared to the
combined loss at 7700 and 7900.
zerodha.com/varsity

136

The calculation is as simple as that. However, I’ve used only 3 strikes in the example for
simplicity. But in reality there are many strikes for a given underlying, especially Nifty.
Calculations become a bit cumbersome and confusing, hence one would have to resort
to a tool like excel.
I’ve calculated the option pain value as of today (10th May 2016) on excel, have a look at
the image –

For all the available strikes, we assume market would expire at that point and then
compute the Rupee value of the loss for CE and PE option writers. This value is shown
in the last column titled “Total Value”. Once you calculate the total value, we simply
have to identify the point at which the least amount of money is lost by the option
writer. You can identify this by plotting the ‘bar graph’ of the total value. The bar graph
would look like this –

zerodha.com/varsity

137

As you can see, the 7800 strike is the point at which option writers would lose the least
amount of money, so as per the option pain theory, 7800 is where the market is likely to
expire for the May series.
Now that you have established the expiry level, how can you use this information? Well,
there are multiple ways you can use this information.
Most traders use this max pain level to identity the strikes which they can write. In this
case, since 7800 is the expected expiry level, one can choose to write call options above
7800 or put options below 7800 and collect all the premiums.

13.4 – A Few Modifications
In the initial days, I was very eager to learn about Option Pain. Everything about it made
absolute sense. I remember crunching numbers, identifying the expiry level, and writing
options to glory. But shockingly the market would expire at some other point leaving me
booking a loss and I wondering if I was wrong with my calculations or if the entire
theory is flawed!
So I eventually improvised on the classic option pain theory to suit my risk appetite.
Here is what I did –
1. The OI values change every day. This means the option pain could suggest 7800
as the expiry level on 10th of May and may very well suggest 8000 on 20th of May.
zerodha.com/varsity

138

I froze on a particular day of the month to run this computation. I preferred
doing this when there were 15 days to expiry.
2. I identified the expiry value as per the regular option pain method.
3. I would add a 5% ‘safety buffer’. So at 15 days to expiry, the theory suggest 7800
as expiry, then I’d add a 5% safety buffer. This would make the expiry value as
7800 + 5% of 7800 = 8190 or 8200 strike.
4. I would expect the market to expire at any point between 7800 to 8200.
5. I would set up strategies keeping this expiry range in mind, my most favorite
being to write call options beyond 8200.
6. I would avoid writing Put option for this simple belief – panic spreads faster than
greed. This means markets can fall faster than it can go up.
7. I would hold the options sold up to expiry, and would usually avoid averaging
during this period.
The results were much better when I followed this method. Unfortunately, I never
tabulated the results, hence I cannot quantify my gains. However if you come from a
programming background, you can easily back test this logic and share the results with
the rest of community here. Anyway, at a much later stage I realized the 5% buffer was
essentially taking to strikes which were approximately 1.5 to 2% standard deviations
away, which meant the probability of markets moving beyond the expected expiry level
was about 34%.
If you are not sure what this means, I’d suggest you read this chapter on standard
deviation and distribution of returns.

13.5 – The Put Call Ratio
The Put Call Ratio is a fairly simple ratio to calculate. The ratio helps us identify extreme
bullishness or bearishness in the market. PCR is usually considered a contrarian
indicator. Meaning, if the PCR indicates extreme bearishness, then we expect the market
to reverse, hence the trader turns bullish. Likewise if PCR indicates extreme bullishness,
then traders expect markets to reverse and decline.

To calculate PCR, all one needs to do is divide the total open interest of Puts by the total
open interest of the Calls. The resulting value usually varies in and around one. Have a
look at the image below –

As on 10th May, the total OI of both Calls and Puts has been calculated. Dividing the Put
OI by Call OI gives us the PCR ratio –
37016925 / 42874200 = 0.863385
The interpretation is as follows –


If the PCR value is above 1, say 1.3 – then it suggests that there are more Puts



being bought compared to Calls. This suggests that the markets have turned
extremely bearish, and therefore sort of oversold. One can look for reversals and
expect the markets to go up.
Low PCR values such as 0.5 and below indicates that there are more calls being
bought compared to puts. This suggests that the markets have turned extremely
bullish, and therefore sort of overbought. Once can look for reversals and expect
the markets to go down.



All values between 0.5 and 1 can be attributed to regular trading activity and can
be ignored.

Needless to say, this is a generic approach to PCR. What would really make sense is to
historically plot the daily PCR values for say 1 or 2 years and identify these extreme
values. For example for Nifty value such as 1.3 can indicate extreme bearishness, but for
say Infy something like 1.2 could be extreme bearishness. So you need to be clear about
this, hence back testing helps.
You may wonder why the PCR is used as a contrarian indicator. Well, the explanation to
this is rather tricky, but the general opinion is this – if the traders are bearish/bullish,
then most of them have already taken their respective position (hence a high/low PCR)
and therefore there aren’t many other players who can come in and drive the positions
in the desired direction. Hence the position will eventually be squared off which would
drive the stock/index in the opposite direction.
So that’s PCR for you. You may come across many variants of this – some prefer to take
the total traded value instead of OI, some even prefer to take the volumes. But I
personally don’t think it is required to over-think PCR.

13.6 – Final thoughts
And with this, I’d like to end this module on Options, which has spread across 2
modules and 36 chapters!
We have discussed close to 15 different option strategies in this module, which I
personally think is more than sufficient for retail traders to trade options professionally.
Yes, going forward you will encounter many fancy option strategies, perhaps your friend
will suggest a fancy option strategy and show off the technicalities of the strategy, but do
remember – ‘fancy’ does not really translate to profit. Some of the best strategies are
simple , elegant and easy to implement.
The content we have presented in both, Module 5 and Module 6, is written with an
intention of giving you a clear picture on options trading - what is possible to be achieve
with options trading and what is not possible. We have thought through and discussed
what is required and what isn’t. Frankly these two modules are more than sufficient to
answer most of your concerns/doubts related to options.

So please do take some time to read through the contents here, at your own pace, and
I’m certain you will you will start trading options the way it is supposed to be done.
Finally, I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing this for you.
Good luck and stay profitable!

Key takeaways from this chapter
1. Option Pain theory assumes that the option writers tend to make more money
consistently compared to option buyers.
2. Option pain assumes that option writers can influence the price of options on the
day of expiry.
3. One can use the theory of option pain to identify the price at which the
stock/index is likely to expiry.
4. The strike at which the option writers would experience least amount of loss is
the strike at which the stock/index likely to expire.
5. The PCR is calculated by dividing the total open interest of Puts by the total open
interest of the Calls.
6. The PCR is considered as a contrarian indicator.
7. Generally a PCR value of over 1.3 is considered bearish and a PCR value of less
than 0.5 is considered bullish.
