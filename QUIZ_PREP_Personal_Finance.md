## üí∞ **PERSONAL FINANCE MATHEMATICS**

### **3. COMPOUND INTEREST**

#### **The Compound Interest Formula**
**Formula**: A = P(1 + r)^t
Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial investment)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- t = Time in years

#### **Real vs Nominal Returns**
**Nominal Return**: Return without adjusting for inflation
**Real Return**: Return after adjusting for inflation
**Formula**: Real Return = [(1 + Nominal Return) √∑ (1 + Inflation)] - 1

#### **Rule of 72**
**Quick Calculation**: Years to double money = 72 √∑ Annual Return %
**Examples**:
- 12% return: 72 √∑ 12 = 6 years to double
- 8% return: 72 √∑ 8 = 9 years to double
- 6% return: 72 √∑ 6 = 12 years to double

### **4. RETIREMENT CORPUS CALCULATION**

#### **Practical Retirement Planning**
**Current Monthly Expenses**: ‚Çπ50,000
**Years to Retirement**: 30 years
**Inflation Rate**: 6% annually
**Safe Withdrawal Rate**: 4% annually

**Step-by-Step Calculation**:
```
Future Monthly Expenses = ‚Çπ50,000 √ó (1.06)^30 = ‚Çπ2,87,175
Annual Requirement = ‚Çπ2,87,175 √ó 12 = ‚Çπ34,46,100
Corpus Required = ‚Çπ34,46,100 √∑ 0.04 = ‚Çπ8.61 Crores
```

#### **SIP Planning for Retirement**
**Required Corpus**: ‚Çπ8.61 Crores
**Investment Period**: 30 years
**Expected Return**: 12% annually
**Required Monthly SIP**: ‚Çπ29,100 approximately
