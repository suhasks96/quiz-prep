## üî¢ **DETAILED MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS**

### **12. STEP-BY-STEP PERSONAL FINANCE CALCULATIONS**

#### **Simple Interest vs Compound Interest - Complete Example**

**Scenario**: ‚Çπ1,00,000 invested for 5 years at 10% per annum

**Simple Interest Calculation:**
```
Formula: Simple Interest = Principal √ó Rate √ó Time
Principal = ‚Çπ1,00,000
Rate = 10% per annum
Time = 5 years

Annual Interest = ‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó 10% = ‚Çπ10,000

Year-wise Breakdown:
Year 1: Principal ‚Çπ1,00,000 + Interest ‚Çπ10,000
Year 2: Principal ‚Çπ1,00,000 + Interest ‚Çπ10,000  
Year 3: Principal ‚Çπ1,00,000 + Interest ‚Çπ10,000
Year 4: Principal ‚Çπ1,00,000 + Interest ‚Çπ10,000
Year 5: Principal ‚Çπ1,00,000 + Interest ‚Çπ10,000

Total Interest = ‚Çπ10,000 √ó 5 = ‚Çπ50,000
Total Amount = ‚Çπ1,00,000 + ‚Çπ50,000 = ‚Çπ1,50,000
```

**Compound Interest Calculation:**
```
Formula: Amount = P √ó (1 + R)^n
P = ‚Çπ1,00,000
R = 10% = 0.10
n = 5 years

Amount = ‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó (1 + 0.10)^5
       = ‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó (1.10)^5
       = ‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó 1.61051
       = ‚Çπ1,61,051

Compound Interest = ‚Çπ1,61,051 - ‚Çπ1,00,000 = ‚Çπ61,051

Additional earning through compounding = ‚Çπ61,051 - ‚Çπ50,000 = ‚Çπ11,051
```

#### **SIP Future Value Calculation - Complete Example**

**Scenario**: ‚Çπ10,000 monthly SIP for 20 years at 12% CAGR

**SIP Future Value Formula:**
```
FV = P √ó [((1+r)^n - 1) / r] √ó (1+r)

Where:
P = Monthly SIP amount = ‚Çπ10,000
r = Monthly rate = 12% √∑ 12 = 1% = 0.01
n = Total months = 20 √ó 12 = 240

FV = ‚Çπ10,000 √ó [((1+0.01)^240 - 1) / 0.01] √ó (1+0.01)

Step-by-step calculation:
(1.01)^240 = 10.8926
((1.01)^240 - 1) = 10.8926 - 1 = 9.8926
9.8926 √∑ 0.01 = 989.26
989.26 √ó 1.01 = 999.15

FV = ‚Çπ10,000 √ó 999.15 = ‚Çπ99,91,530

Total Investment = ‚Çπ10,000 √ó 240 = ‚Çπ24,00,000
Total Returns = ‚Çπ99,91,530 - ‚Çπ24,00,000 = ‚Çπ75,91,530
```

#### **EMI Calculation - Complete Example**

**Scenario**: Home loan of ‚Çπ50,00,000 for 20 years at 8.5% interest

**EMI Formula:**
```
EMI = [P √ó R √ó (1+R)^n] / [(1+R)^n - 1]

Where:
P = Principal loan amount = ‚Çπ50,00,000
R = Monthly interest rate = 8.5% √∑ 12 = 0.7083% = 0.007083
n = Total months = 20 √ó 12 = 240

EMI = [‚Çπ50,00,000 √ó 0.007083 √ó (1.007083)^240] / [(1.007083)^240 - 1]

Step-by-step calculation:
(1.007083)^240 = 5.2945
Numerator = ‚Çπ50,00,000 √ó 0.007083 √ó 5.2945 = ‚Çπ1,87,476
Denominator = 5.2945 - 1 = 4.2945

EMI = ‚Çπ1,87,476 √∑ 4.2945 = ‚Çπ43,649

Total Amount Payable = ‚Çπ43,649 √ó 240 = ‚Çπ1,04,76,000
Total Interest = ‚Çπ1,04,76,000 - ‚Çπ50,00,000 = ‚Çπ54,76,000
```

#### **CAGR vs Absolute Return - Detailed Examples**

**Example 1: Lumpsum Investment (3 years)**
```
Investment: ‚Çπ1,00,000 grows to ‚Çπ1,33,100 in 3 years

Absolute Return = (Final Value √∑ Initial Value - 1) √ó 100
                = (‚Çπ1,33,100 √∑ ‚Çπ1,00,000 - 1) √ó 100
                = (1.331 - 1) √ó 100 = 33.1%

CAGR = [(Final Value √∑ Initial Value)^(1/years) - 1] √ó 100
     = [(‚Çπ1,33,100 √∑ ‚Çπ1,00,000)^(1/3) - 1] √ó 100
     = [(1.331)^0.3333 - 1] √ó 100
     = [1.10 - 1] √ó 100 = 10%

Interpretation: 33.1% total return over 3 years = 10% annual growth rate
```

**Example 2: XIRR for SIP (Multi-year)**
```
Monthly SIP: ‚Çπ5,000 for 19 months
Current Value: ‚Çπ1,10,000
Total Invested: ‚Çπ95,000

Using Excel XIRR function with cash flow dates:
Investment dates and amounts (negative cash flows)
Current value date and amount (positive cash flow)

XIRR Result: 18.79% annualized return

Verification:
Absolute Return = (‚Çπ1,10,000 √∑ ‚Çπ95,000 - 1) √ó 100 = 15.79%
But this doesn't account for time - XIRR gives time-adjusted return
```

#### **Retirement Corpus Planning - Step-by-Step**

**Goal**: ‚Çπ5 crore corpus in 25 years for retirement

**Future Value of Current Savings:**
```
Current savings: ‚Çπ5,00,000
Expected return: 12% CAGR
Time: 25 years

Future Value = ‚Çπ5,00,000 √ó (1.12)^25
             = ‚Çπ5,00,000 √ó 17.000
             = ‚Çπ85,00,000
```

**Required SIP Calculation:**
```
Target corpus: ‚Çπ5,00,00,000
Less: FV of current savings: ‚Çπ85,00,000
Gap to be filled through SIP: ‚Çπ4,15,00,000

Using SIP formula rearranged to find P:
P = Target FV √∑ [((1+r)^n - 1) / r] √ó (1+r)

Monthly rate (r) = 12% √∑ 12 = 1%
Months (n) = 25 √ó 12 = 300

P = ‚Çπ4,15,00,000 √∑ [((1.01)^300 - 1) / 0.01] √ó 1.01
P = ‚Çπ4,15,00,000 √∑ 1956.18
P = ‚Çπ21,212

Required monthly SIP: ‚Çπ21,212
```

#### **Real Estate Yield Calculations**

**Property Investment Analysis:**
```
Purchase Price: ‚Çπ1,00,00,000
Monthly Rent: ‚Çπ50,000
Holding Period: 5 years
Sale Price: ‚Çπ1,40,00,000

Annual Rental Yield:
= (Monthly Rent √ó 12) √∑ Purchase Price √ó 100
= (‚Çπ50,000 √ó 12) √∑ ‚Çπ1,00,00,000 √ó 100
= ‚Çπ6,00,000 √∑ ‚Çπ1,00,00,000 √ó 100 = 6%

Total Return Calculation:
Total Rental Income = ‚Çπ6,00,000 √ó 5 = ‚Çπ30,00,000
Capital Appreciation = ‚Çπ1,40,00,000 - ‚Çπ1,00,00,000 = ‚Çπ40,00,000
Total Returns = ‚Çπ30,00,000 + ‚Çπ40,00,000 = ‚Çπ70,00,000

CAGR = [(‚Çπ1,70,00,000 √∑ ‚Çπ1,00,00,000)^(1/5) - 1] √ó 100
     = [(1.70)^0.20 - 1] √ó 100
     = [1.1137 - 1] √ó 100 = 11.37%
```

#### **Mutual Fund Performance Metrics**

**Sharpe Ratio Calculation:**
```
Fund A: 15% return, 20% volatility
Fund B: 12% return, 10% volatility
Risk-free rate: 6%

Sharpe Ratio A = (15% - 6%) √∑ 20% = 9% √∑ 20% = 0.45
Sharpe Ratio B = (12% - 6%) √∑ 10% = 6% √∑ 10% = 0.60

Interpretation: Fund B provides better risk-adjusted returns
(0.60 units of excess return per unit of risk vs 0.45 for Fund A)
```

**Alpha Calculation:**
```
Fund Return: 14%
Benchmark Return: 10%
Beta: 1.2
Risk-free Rate: 6%

Alpha = (Fund Return - Risk-free Rate) - Beta √ó (Benchmark Return - Risk-free Rate)
      = (14% - 6%) - 1.2 √ó (10% - 6%)
      = 8% - 1.2 √ó 4%
      = 8% - 4.8% = 3.2%

Interpretation: Fund generated 3.2% excess risk-adjusted return over benchmark
```

## üèÜ **ADVANCED PERSONAL FINANCE CONCEPTS**

### **12. BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND BIASES**

#### **Common Investment Biases Comparison**

| **BIAS** | **DESCRIPTION** | **IMPACT** | **SOLUTION** |
|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Fear losses more than equivalent gains | Hold losing investments too long | Systematic profit booking |
| **Overconfidence** | Overestimate investment abilities | Excessive trading, poor diversification | Passive investing, professional help |
| **Herding** | Follow crowd behavior | Buy high, sell low | Contrarian approach |
| **Anchoring** | Stick to first piece of information | Poor price references | Regular research updates |

#### **Systematic Investment Approach**
**Goal Setting**: Specific, measurable, time-bound objectives
**Risk Assessment**: Understanding true risk tolerance
**Product Selection**: Based on goals, not marketing
**Regular Monitoring**: Periodic review and rebalancing
**Discipline**: Stick to plan despite market volatility

**REMEMBER**: Personal finance success depends more on consistent behavior than perfect investment selection. Diversification across asset classes and time (through SIPs) are key risk management tools. Understanding the trade-offs between different investment options helps make informed decisions based on individual circumstances.

**EXAM FOCUS**: Master the comparisons between different investment vehicles, understand asset allocation principles, know the characteristics of various mutual fund types, and be familiar with tax-efficient investing strategies. The ability to match investment products with investor profiles is crucial.
