## 💰 **PERSONAL FINANCE MATHEMATICS**

### **3. COMPOUND INTEREST**

#### **The Compound Interest Formula**
**Formula**: A = P(1 + r)^t
Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial investment)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- t = Time in years

#### **Real vs Nominal Returns**
**Nominal Return**: Return without adjusting for inflation
**Real Return**: Return after adjusting for inflation
**Formula**: Real Return = [(1 + Nominal Return) ÷ (1 + Inflation)] - 1

#### **Rule of 72**
**Quick Calculation**: Years to double money = 72 ÷ Annual Return %
**Examples**:
- 12% return: 72 ÷ 12 = 6 years to double
- 8% return: 72 ÷ 8 = 9 years to double
- 6% return: 72 ÷ 6 = 12 years to double

#### **Power of Compounding Examples**
**₹1,000 monthly SIP at 12% annual return**:
- 10 years: ₹2,32,339
- 20 years: ₹9,89,255
- 30 years: ₹35,27,603

### **4. TIME VALUE OF MONEY**

#### **Present Value (PV)**
**Concept**: Today's value of future money
**Formula**: PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)^t
**Application**: How much to invest today for future goal

#### **Future Value (FV)**
**Concept**: Future value of today's money
**Formula**: FV = PV × (1 + r)^t
**Application**: What current investment will be worth in future

#### **Annuity Calculations**
**Ordinary Annuity**: Payments at end of period
**Annuity Due**: Payments at beginning of period
**SIP Calculation**: Future value of regular monthly investments

## 🏖️ **RETIREMENT PLANNING**

### **5. THE RETIREMENT PROBLEM**

#### **Retirement Challenges**
**Inflation Impact**: ₹1 today ≠ ₹1 in future purchasing power
**Longevity Risk**: Living longer than money lasts
**Healthcare Costs**: Medical expenses increase with age
**Lifestyle Maintenance**: Maintaining desired standard of living

#### **Retirement Corpus Calculation**
**Steps**:
1. **Current Monthly Expenses**: Calculate today's spending
2. **Inflation Adjustment**: Project future monthly expenses
3. **Annual Requirement**: Future monthly × 12
4. **Corpus Required**: Annual requirement ÷ Safe withdrawal rate

#### **Example Calculation**
**Current Monthly Expenses**: ₹50,000
**Years to Retirement**: 30 years
**Inflation Rate**: 6% annually
**Safe Withdrawal Rate**: 4% annually

**Future Monthly Expenses**: ₹50,000 × (1.06)^30 = ₹2,87,175
**Annual Requirement**: ₹2,87,175 × 12 = ₹34,46,100
**Corpus Required**: ₹34,46,100 ÷ 0.04 = ₹8,61,52,500

#### **Retirement Planning Strategies**
**Start Early**: Leverage power of compounding
**Regular Investments**: Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)
**Diversified Portfolio**: Mix of equity and debt
**Periodic Review**: Adjust plan based on life changes
