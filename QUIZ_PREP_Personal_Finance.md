## üí∞ **PERSONAL FINANCE MATHEMATICS**

### **3. COMPOUND INTEREST**

#### **The Compound Interest Formula**
**Formula**: A = P(1 + r)^t
Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial investment)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- t = Time in years

#### **Real vs Nominal Returns**
**Nominal Return**: Return without adjusting for inflation
**Real Return**: Return after adjusting for inflation
**Formula**: Real Return = [(1 + Nominal Return) √∑ (1 + Inflation)] - 1

#### **Rule of 72**
**Quick Calculation**: Years to double money = 72 √∑ Annual Return %
**Examples**:
- 12% return: 72 √∑ 12 = 6 years to double
- 8% return: 72 √∑ 8 = 9 years to double
- 6% return: 72 √∑ 6 = 12 years to double

#### **Power of Compounding Examples**
**‚Çπ1,000 monthly SIP at 12% annual return**:
- 10 years: ‚Çπ2,32,339
- 20 years: ‚Çπ9,89,255
- 30 years: ‚Çπ35,27,603

### **4. TIME VALUE OF MONEY**

#### **Present Value (PV)**
**Concept**: Today's value of future money
**Formula**: PV = FV √∑ (1 + r)^t
**Application**: How much to invest today for future goal

#### **Future Value (FV)**
**Concept**: Future value of today's money
**Formula**: FV = PV √ó (1 + r)^t
**Application**: What current investment will be worth in future

#### **Annuity Calculations**
**Ordinary Annuity**: Payments at end of period
**Annuity Due**: Payments at beginning of period
**SIP Calculation**: Future value of regular monthly investments

#### **Retirement Corpus Calculation**
**Steps**:
1. **Current Monthly Expenses**: Calculate today's spending
2. **Inflation Adjustment**: Project future monthly expenses
3. **Annual Requirement**: Future monthly √ó 12
4. **Corpus Required**: Annual requirement √∑ Safe withdrawal rate

#### **Example Calculation**
**Current Monthly Expenses**: ‚Çπ50,000
**Years to Retirement**: 30 years
**Inflation Rate**: 6% annually
**Safe Withdrawal Rate**: 4% annually

**Future Monthly Expenses**: ‚Çπ50,000 √ó (1.06)^30 = ‚Çπ2,87,175
**Annual Requirement**: ‚Çπ2,87,175 √ó 12 = ‚Çπ34,46,100
**Corpus Required**: ‚Çπ34,46,100 √∑ 0.04 = ‚Çπ8,61,52,500
