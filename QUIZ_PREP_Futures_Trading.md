**Futures Contracts (Standardized):**
- **Exchange-Traded**: NSE, BSE for derivatives

### **2. FUTURES TRADING MECHANICS**

#### **Key Components**
- **Underlying Asset**: Stock, index, commodity, currency
- **Lot Size**: Minimum tradeable quantity
- **Expiry Date**: Last Thursday of expiry month (equity)
- **Margin**: Upfront amount required to trade
- **Settlement**: Cash settled for indices, physical for commodities

#### **Contract Specifications (Nifty Futures Example)**
- **Underlying**: Nifty 50 Index
- **Lot Size**: 50 units (Nifty Ã— 50)
- **Tick Size**: 0.05 points
- **Expiry**: Last Thursday of month
- **Settlement**: Cash settled
- **Trading Hours**: 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM

### **3. LEVERAGE & MARGIN SYSTEM**

#### **Leverage Concept**
**Leverage = Contract Value / Margin Required**

**Example:**
- **Nifty Level**: 18,000
- **Contract Value**: 18,000 Ã— 50 = â‚¹9,00,000
- **Margin Required**: ~â‚¹90,000 (10%)
- **Leverage**: 9,00,000 / 90,000 = 10x

#### **Types of Margins**
**Initial Margin:**
- **SPAN**: Standardized Portfolio Analysis of Risk
- **Exposure Margin**: Additional buffer (usually 3-5%)
- **Total Initial Margin**: SPAN + Exposure margin

**Maintenance Margin:**
- **Minimum Balance**: Required to keep position open
- **Margin Call**: If margin falls below maintenance level

#### **Mark-to-Market (M2M)**
**Daily Settlement Process:**
- **Daily P&L**: Calculated based on closing price
- **Profit**: Added to margin account
- **Loss**: Deducted from margin account
- **Margin Call**: If margin insufficient, add funds or close position

### **4. FUTURES PAYOFF PROFILES**

#### **Long Futures Position**
**Profit Formula**: (Sell Price - Buy Price) Ã— Lot Size
- **Unlimited Upside**: Profit increases as price rises
- **Unlimited Downside**: Loss increases as price falls
- **Linear Payoff**: 1:1 relationship with underlying movement

#### **Short Futures Position**
**Profit Formula**: (Sell Price - Buy Price) Ã— Lot Size
- **Limited Upside**: Maximum profit when underlying goes to zero
- **Unlimited Downside**: Loss increases as price rises
- **Linear Payoff**: Inverse relationship with underlying

#### **Practical Example**
**Buy Nifty Futures at 18,000:**
- **If Nifty closes at 18,100**: Profit = (18,100 - 18,000) Ã— 50 = â‚¹5,000
- **If Nifty closes at 17,900**: Loss = (17,900 - 18,000) Ã— 50 = -â‚¹5,000

### **5. FUTURES PRICING & COST OF CARRY**

#### **Theoretical Fair Value**
**Futures Price = Spot Price Ã— e^(rÃ—t)**
Where:
- r = Risk-free interest rate
- t = Time to expiry (in years)

#### **Cost of Carry Model**
**For Dividend-Paying Stocks:**
**Futures Price = (Spot Price - PV of Dividends) Ã— e^(rÃ—t)**

#### **Basis & Convergence**
- **Basis**: Futures Price - Spot Price
- **Contango**: Futures > Spot (normal market)
- **Backwardation**: Futures < Spot (stressed market)
- **Convergence**: Futures and spot prices converge at expiry

### **6. PRACTICAL TRADING STRATEGIES**

#### **Hedging Strategies**
**Long Stock + Short Futures:**
- **Purpose**: Protect against price decline
- **Example**: Own 1000 shares, sell 20 futures contracts (if 50 lot size)
- **Result**: Portfolio becomes market-neutral

**Short Stock + Long Futures:**
- **Purpose**: Protect against price rise in short position
- **Risk Management**: Limited upside exposure

#### **Speculation Strategies**
**Directional Trading:**
- **Bullish View**: Buy futures contracts
- **Bearish View**: Sell futures contracts
- **Leverage**: Amplifies both profits and losses

#### **Arbitrage Opportunities**
**Cash-Futures Arbitrage:**
- **When**: Futures significantly overpriced vs fair value
- **Action**: Buy cash, sell futures
- **Profit**: Capture the price differential

### **7. RISK MANAGEMENT IN FUTURES**

#### **Position Sizing**
**Risk per Trade**: Never risk more than 2% of capital
**Calculation**: Position size = (Risk amount) / (Stop loss in points)

#### **Stop Loss Strategies**
- **Percentage-based**: 2-3% from entry price
- **Technical Levels**: Support/resistance levels
- **Volatility-based**: Based on Average True Range (ATR)

#### **Common Mistakes**
1. **Over-leveraging**: Using maximum available leverage
2. **Ignoring M2M**: Not maintaining sufficient margin
3. **No Stop Loss**: Unlimited loss potential
4. **Emotional Trading**: Adding to losing positions
