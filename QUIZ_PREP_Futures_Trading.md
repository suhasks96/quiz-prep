## ðŸ’¡ **POSITION SIZING IN FUTURES TRADING**

### **8. COMPREHENSIVE POSITION SIZING STRATEGIES**

#### **Position Sizing Methods for Futures**

| **METHOD** | **CALCULATION** | **RISK FOCUS** | **SUITABILITY** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Fixed Contract** | Same number of contracts | Simple approach | Beginners |
| **Fixed Capital** | Same rupee exposure | Capital consistency | Conservative traders |
| **Risk-Based** | Based on maximum loss tolerance | Risk management | Professional traders |
| **Volatility-Adjusted** | Inverse to volatility | Risk equalization | Advanced traders |

#### **Method 1: Fixed Contract Approach**
**Strategy**: Trade same number of contracts regardless of price
**Example**: Always trade 1 lot of Nifty futures
**Advantage**: Simple execution
**Disadvantage**: Risk varies with price levels

**Practical Example**:
- Nifty at 18,000: Risk = 18,000 Ã— 75 = â‚¹13,50,000 exposure
- Nifty at 20,000: Risk = 20,000 Ã— 75 = â‚¹15,00,000 exposure
- Risk Difference = â‚¹1,50,000 (11% higher risk)

#### **Method 2: Fixed Capital Approach**
**Strategy**: Maintain same rupee exposure across trades
**Calculation**: Number of Lots = Target Exposure Ã· Contract Value

**Detailed Example**:
**Target Exposure**: â‚¹10,00,000
**Nifty at 18,000**: Contract Value = 18,000 Ã— 75 = â‚¹13,50,000
**Lots Required**: â‚¹10,00,000 Ã· â‚¹13,50,000 = 0.74 lots â‰ˆ 1 lot
**Actual Exposure**: 1 Ã— â‚¹13,50,000 = â‚¹13,50,000

**Nifty at 15,000**: Contract Value = 15,000 Ã— 75 = â‚¹11,25,000
**Lots Required**: â‚¹10,00,000 Ã· â‚¹11,25,000 = 0.89 lots â‰ˆ 1 lot
**Actual Exposure**: 1 Ã— â‚¹11,25,000 = â‚¹11,25,000

#### **Method 3: Risk-Based Position Sizing**
**Strategy**: Size positions based on maximum acceptable loss
**Formula**: Position Size = Risk Amount Ã· (Stop Loss Distance Ã— Lot Size)

**Comprehensive Example**:
**Trading Capital**: â‚¹10,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 2% = â‚¹20,000
**Nifty Current Price**: 18,000
**Stop Loss Level**: 17,400 (600 points below)
**Lot Size**: 75

**Calculation**:
Position Size = â‚¹20,000 Ã· (600 Ã— 75) = â‚¹20,000 Ã· â‚¹45,000 = 0.44 lots

**Practical Decision**: Trade 0 lots (risk too high) or accept higher risk with 1 lot

**Alternative with Smaller Stop**:
**Stop Loss Level**: 17,800 (200 points below)
Position Size = â‚¹20,000 Ã· (200 Ã— 75) = â‚¹20,000 Ã· â‚¹15,000 = 1.33 lots â‰ˆ 1 lot

#### **Method 4: Volatility-Adjusted Sizing**
**Strategy**: Reduce position size when volatility is high
**Formula**: Base Position Size Ã— (Average Volatility Ã· Current Volatility)

**Practical Example**:
**Base Position**: 2 lots when volatility is normal
**Average VIX**: 20
**Current VIX**: 30 (high volatility)
**Adjusted Position**: 2 Ã— (20 Ã· 30) = 1.33 lots â‰ˆ 1 lot

**When VIX = 15** (low volatility):
**Adjusted Position**: 2 Ã— (20 Ã· 15) = 2.67 lots â‰ˆ 3 lots

## ðŸ“Š **PRACTICAL POSITION SIZING EXAMPLES**

### **9. REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS**

#### **Scenario 1: Conservative Trader**
**Profile**: â‚¹5,00,000 capital, 1% risk per trade, long-term view
**Risk per Trade**: â‚¹5,000
**Target**: Nifty long at 18,000, stop at 17,700

**Calculation**:
- Stop Loss Distance: 300 points
- Loss per Lot: 300 Ã— 75 = â‚¹22,500
- Position Size: â‚¹5,000 Ã· â‚¹22,500 = 0.22 lots
- **Decision**: No trade (position too small) or accept higher risk

**Alternative Approach**: Use Bank Nifty with smaller lot size
**Bank Nifty at 42,000, Stop at 41,500** (500 points)
- Loss per Lot: 500 Ã— 25 = â‚¹12,500
- Position Size: â‚¹5,000 Ã· â‚¹12,500 = 0.4 lots
- **Decision**: Still too small, consider options or cash market

#### **Scenario 2: Aggressive Trader**
**Profile**: â‚¹20,00,000 capital, 3% risk per trade, active trading
**Risk per Trade**: â‚¹60,000
**Target**: Nifty short at 19,000, stop at 19,400

**Calculation**:
- Stop Loss Distance: 400 points  
- Loss per Lot: 400 Ã— 75 = â‚¹30,000
- Position Size: â‚¹60,000 Ã· â‚¹30,000 = 2 lots
- **Margin Required**: 2 Ã— â‚¹1,23,500 = â‚¹2,47,000
- **Margin Utilization**: â‚¹2,47,000 Ã· â‚¹20,00,000 = 12.4%

**Risk Management Check**:
- **Maximum Loss**: â‚¹60,000 (3% of capital) âœ“
- **Margin Comfort**: 12.4% utilization allows for mark-to-market âœ“
- **Position Manageable**: 2 lots easy to monitor âœ“

#### **Scenario 3: Hedging Example**
**Profile**: Equity portfolio worth â‚¹1,00,00,000, hedge 50%
**Hedge Value**: â‚¹50,00,000
**Nifty Level**: 20,000
**Contract Value**: 20,000 Ã— 75 = â‚¹15,00,000

**Hedge Calculation**:
- Futures Required: â‚¹50,00,000 Ã· â‚¹15,00,000 = 3.33 lots
- **Hedge Decision**: Sell 3 lots of Nifty futures
- **Hedge Coverage**: 3 Ã— â‚¹15,00,000 = â‚¹45,00,000 (90% hedge)
- **Margin Required**: 3 Ã— â‚¹97,500 = â‚¹2,92,500
