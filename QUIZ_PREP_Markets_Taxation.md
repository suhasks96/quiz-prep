## 📈 **TAXATION FOR INVESTORS**

### **4. SHORT-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (STCG)**

**Tax Rate**: 15% + 4% cess = 15.6% total
**Conditions**: Listed shares traded on recognized exchanges

**Calculation**: (Sale Price - Purchase Price) × 15.6%

#### **Mutual Funds STCG**
**Equity MF**: 15% + cess (holding < 1 year)
**Debt MF**: As per slab rate (holding < 3 years)
**Hybrid MF**: Based on equity exposure (>65% = equity treatment)

#### **STCG Calculation Example**
```
Purchase: ₹100 per share on Jan 1, 2024
Sale: ₹120 per share on Jun 1, 2024 (5 months holding)
Gain: ₹20 per share
STCG Tax: ₹20 × 15.6% = ₹3.12 per share
```

### **5. LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (LTCG)**

#### **Equity LTCG (Holding > 12 months)**
**Tax Rate**: 10% + 4% cess = 10.4% (on gains > ₹1 lakh)
**Annual Exemption**: ₹1 lakh per financial year
**Grandfathering**: Cost basis as on Jan 31, 2018 for pre-2018 purchases

Exempt Amount: ₹1,00,000

Tax: ₹2,00,000 × 10.4% = ₹20,800
```

**Rule**: When selling partial holdings, oldest shares sold first
**Record Keeping**: Maintain date-wise purchase records

June 1, 2023: Bought 100 shares at ₹820
May 1, 2024: Sold 150 shares at ₹920

FIFO Calculation:
- 100 shares from April 10 (LTCG): ₹(920-800) × 100 = ₹12,000
- 50 shares from June 1 (STCG): ₹(920-820) × 50 = ₹5,000
```
