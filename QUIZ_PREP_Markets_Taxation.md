## 🔢 **DETAILED MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS**

### **10. STEP-BY-STEP TAX CALCULATIONS**

#### **Business Income Calculation - Complete Example**
**Trader Profile**: F&O + Intraday Equity Trading
**Income Details:**
- Salary: ₹10,00,000
- F&O Profit (Non-speculative): ₹1,00,000  
- Intraday Equity Profit (Speculative): ₹1,00,000
- STCG from Delivery: ₹1,00,000

**Step-by-Step Tax Calculation:**

**Step 1: Calculate Total Taxable Income (Business + Salary)**
```
Total Regular Income = Salary + Non-speculative + Speculative
                     = ₹10,00,000 + ₹1,00,000 + ₹1,00,000
                     = ₹12,00,000
```

**Step 2: Apply Tax Slabs (Old Regime)**
```
Slab 1: ₹0 to ₹2,50,000 → ₹2,50,000 × 0% = ₹0
Slab 2: ₹2,50,000 to ₹5,00,000 → ₹2,50,000 × 10% = ₹25,000
Slab 3: ₹5,00,000 to ₹10,00,000 → ₹5,00,000 × 20% = ₹1,00,000
Slab 4: ₹10,00,000 to ₹12,00,000 → ₹2,00,000 × 30% = ₹60,000

Total Tax on Regular Income = ₹0 + ₹25,000 + ₹1,00,000 + ₹60,000 = ₹1,85,000
```

**Step 3: Calculate STCG Tax Separately**
```
STCG Tax = ₹1,00,000 × 15% = ₹15,000
```

**Step 4: Total Tax Liability**
```
Total Tax = Regular Income Tax + STCG Tax
          = ₹1,85,000 + ₹15,000 = ₹2,00,000
```

#### **Indexation Benefit Calculation - Debt Mutual Fund**
**Investment Details:**
- Purchase Value: ₹1,00,000 (Year 2005)
- Sale Value: ₹3,00,000 (Year 2015)
- Cost Inflation Index 2005: 497
- Cost Inflation Index 2015: 1024

**Step-by-Step Indexation Calculation:**

**Step 1: Calculate Indexed Purchase Value**
```
Indexed Purchase Value = Purchase Value × (CII Sale Year ÷ CII Purchase Year)
                       = ₹1,00,000 × (1024 ÷ 497)
                       = ₹1,00,000 × 2.0604
                       = ₹2,06,036
```

**Step 2: Calculate Indexed LTCG**
```
Indexed LTCG = Sale Value - Indexed Purchase Value
             = ₹3,00,000 - ₹2,06,036
             = ₹93,964
```

**Step 3: Calculate Tax with Indexation**
```
Tax with Indexation = ₹93,964 × 20% = ₹18,793

Tax without Indexation = (₹3,00,000 - ₹1,00,000) × 20% = ₹40,000

Tax Savings = ₹40,000 - ₹18,793 = ₹21,207
```

#### **Turnover Calculation for Tax Audit**
**Trading Activity:** Mixed F&O and Equity Trading

**Scenario: F&O Trading Turnover (Trade-wise Method)**
```
Trade 1: Buy 100 Nifty Futures at 8000, Sell at 8100
Profit = (8100 - 8000) × 100 = ₹10,000
Turnover = ₹10,000

Trade 2: Buy 100 Nifty Futures at 8100, Sell at 8050  
Loss = (8050 - 8100) × 100 = -₹5,000
Turnover = ₹5,000 (absolute value)

Total Turnover = ₹10,000 + ₹5,000 = ₹15,000
```

**Scenario: Option Trading Turnover**
```
Buy 100 Nifty 8200 Call at ₹20, Sell at ₹30
Profit = (₹30 - ₹20) × 100 = ₹1,000
Premium Received = ₹30 × 100 = ₹3,000
Total Turnover = ₹1,000 + ₹3,000 = ₹4,000
```

**Scenario: Intraday Equity Turnover (Speculative)**
```
Buy 100 Reliance at ₹800, Sell at ₹820
Profit = (₹820 - ₹800) × 100 = ₹2,000
Turnover = ₹2,000 (absolute profit/loss)
```

#### **Tax Audit Requirements**
**Audit Threshold Analysis:**
```
If Annual Turnover > ₹10 Crores → Audit Mandatory
If Turnover < ₹10 Crores AND Profit < 6% of Turnover → Audit Required

Example:
Turnover = ₹50,00,000
Profit = ₹2,00,000
Profit % = (₹2,00,000 ÷ ₹50,00,000) × 100 = 4%

Since 4% < 6%, Tax Audit Required
```

#### **Loss Set-off and Carry Forward Examples**

**Scenario 1: Speculative vs Non-Speculative Loss Set-off**
```
Income Details:
- Salary: ₹5,00,000
- Non-speculative Profit (F&O): ₹1,00,000
- Speculative Loss (Intraday): ₹1,00,000

Tax Calculation:
Total Taxable Income = ₹5,00,000 + ₹1,00,000 = ₹6,00,000
(Speculative loss CANNOT be set off against non-speculative profit)

Tax Calculation:
Slab 1: ₹2,50,000 × 0% = ₹0
Slab 2: ₹2,50,000 × 10% = ₹25,000  
Slab 3: ₹1,00,000 × 20% = ₹20,000
Total Tax = ₹45,000

Speculative Loss ₹1,00,000 carried forward for 4 years
```

**Scenario 2: Non-Speculative Loss Set-off**
```
Income Details:
- Hotel Business: ₹15,00,000
- Interest Income: ₹2,00,000
- Non-speculative Loss (F&O): ₹7,00,000

Tax Calculation:
Total Income Before Set-off = ₹15,00,000 + ₹2,00,000 = ₹17,00,000
After Loss Set-off = ₹17,00,000 - ₹7,00,000 = ₹10,00,000

Tax on ₹10,00,000:
Slab 1: ₹2,50,000 × 0% = ₹0
Slab 2: ₹2,50,000 × 10% = ₹25,000
Slab 3: ₹5,00,000 × 20% = ₹1,00,000
Total Tax = ₹1,25,000
```

#### **Advance Tax Calculation Example**
**Annual Tax Liability: ₹2,00,000**

**Advance Tax Schedule:**
```
Due Date: June 15th
Amount: 15% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹30,000

Due Date: September 15th  
Amount: 45% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹90,000
Cumulative: ₹30,000 + ₹60,000 = ₹90,000

Due Date: December 15th
Amount: 75% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹1,50,000
Cumulative: ₹90,000 + ₹60,000 = ₹1,50,000

Due Date: March 15th
Amount: 100% of ₹2,00,000 = ₹2,00,000
Cumulative: ₹1,50,000 + ₹50,000 = ₹2,00,000
```

**Interest on Late Payment:**
```
If September installment (₹60,000) paid late by 30 days:
Interest = ₹60,000 × 1% per month = ₹600
```
