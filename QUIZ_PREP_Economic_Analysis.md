### **9. ADVANCED VALUATION MODELS**

#### **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**
**Two-Stage DCF Model:**
```
Stage 1 (High Growth): Years 1-10, 15% growth
Stage 2 (Stable Growth): Year 11+, 3% perpetual growth

Free Cash Flow Projection:
Year 1: ‚Çπ100 cr
Year 10: ‚Çπ100 √ó (1.15)^10 = ‚Çπ405 cr
Terminal Value = FCF‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ / (WACC - g) = ‚Çπ417 cr / (0.11 - 0.03) = ‚Çπ5,212 cr
Present Value = Sum of discounted cash flows + discounted terminal value
```

**Key DCF Components:**
- **Free Cash Flow**: Operating cash flow - Capital expenditure
- **WACC**: Weighted average cost of capital
- **Terminal Growth Rate**: Long-term GDP growth rate (3-4%)
- **Discount Rate**: Risk-free rate + equity risk premium

#### **Relative Valuation Techniques**
**P/E Ratio Analysis:**
```
Justified P/E = (Payout Ratio √ó (1 + g)) / (Required Return - g)
Where:
- Payout Ratio = Dividends / Earnings
- g = Sustainable growth rate
- Required Return = Risk-free rate + beta √ó market risk premium
```

**EV/EBITDA Deep Dive:**
```
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash
EBITDA = Earnings + Interest + Tax + Depreciation + Amortization
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA

Advantages:
- Ignores capital structure differences
- Useful for M&A analysis
- Less affected by accounting policies
```

**Sector-Specific Ratios:**
- **Banking**: P/B ratio, ROE, NIM
- **Technology**: P/S ratio, EV/Revenue
- **Utilities**: Dividend yield, regulated asset base
- **FMCG**: EV/EBITDA, brand value premiums
