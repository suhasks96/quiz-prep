## 🔢 **DETAILED MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS**

### **11. STEP-BY-STEP TRADING SYSTEM CALCULATIONS**

#### **Pair Trading - Complete Mathematical Example**

**Stock Selection**: HDFC Bank (X - Independent) vs ICICI Bank (Y - Dependent)

**Step 1: Linear Regression Analysis**
```
Given Historical Data (252 trading days):
HDFC Bank closing prices: [₹1,400, ₹1,425, ₹1,440, ...]
ICICI Bank closing prices: [₹291, ₹295, ₹298, ...]

Linear Regression Equation: Y = mX + c
Where: ICICI = β × HDFC + α
```

**Step 2: Calculate Error Ratios for Both Combinations**
```
Combination 1: HDFC as X, ICICI as Y
- Standard Error of Intercept: 45.8
- Standard Error of Residuals: 12.3
- Error Ratio = 45.8 ÷ 12.3 = 3.72

Combination 2: ICICI as X, HDFC as Y  
- Standard Error of Intercept: 127.4
- Standard Error of Residuals: 42.6
- Error Ratio = 127.4 ÷ 42.6 = 2.99

Selection: Choose Combination 2 (lower error ratio)
Final Assignment: ICICI = X (Independent), HDFC = Y (Dependent)
```

**Step 3: Final Regression Output**
```
HDFC = 7.613 × ICICI - 663.677

Key Statistics:
- Beta (β): 7.613
- Intercept (α): -663.677
- R-squared: 0.94
- Standard Error: 22.776
- Observations: 252
```

**Step 4: Calculate Residuals and Test Stationarity**
```
For each day: Residual = Actual HDFC - Predicted HDFC
Residual = HDFC_actual - (7.613 × ICICI - 663.677)

Example for Day 1:
HDFC_actual = ₹1,914
ICICI = ₹291
Predicted HDFC = 7.613 × 291 - 663.677 = ₹1,551
Residual = ₹1,914 - ₹1,551 = ₹363
```

**Step 5: ADF Test for Stationarity**
```
Null Hypothesis: Series has unit root (non-stationary)
Alternative: Series is stationary

ADF Test Result:
- ADF Statistic: -3.84
- P-value: 0.012
- Critical Value (5%): -2.87

Conclusion: P-value < 0.05, reject null hypothesis
Residuals are stationary → Stocks are cointegrated
```

**Step 6: Calculate Trading Signals**
```
Residual Statistics:
- Mean: 0.52
- Standard Deviation: 22.78
- Current Residual: -57.8

Z-Score = (Current Residual - Mean) ÷ Standard Deviation
        = (-57.8 - 0.52) ÷ 22.78
        = -2.56

Trading Signal: Z-score < -2.5 → Long Pair Signal
```

#### **Pair Trading Position Sizing Example**

**Trade Setup based on above signals:**
```
Signal: Long Pair (Buy HDFC, Sell ICICI)
Beta Ratio: 7.613 (need 7.613 ICICI shares for 1 HDFC share)

Position Sizing:
Available Capital: ₹10,00,000
Risk per Trade: 2% = ₹20,000

Current Prices:
HDFC: ₹1,914
ICICI: ₹291

For 1:7.613 Ratio:
Cost of 1 HDFC + Margin for 7.613 ICICI short
= ₹1,914 + (7.613 × ₹291 × 20% margin)
= ₹1,914 + ₹444
= ₹2,358 per set

Maximum Sets = ₹10,00,000 ÷ ₹2,358 = 424 sets
Conservative Approach: Use 10% = 42 sets

Final Position:
Long: 42 shares of HDFC = ₹80,388
Short: 320 shares of ICICI (42 × 7.613)
```

#### **Momentum Portfolio Construction - Mathematical Process**

**Universe Selection**: BSE 500 stocks (tracking universe)

**Step 1: Return Calculation (1-Year Period)**
```
Example Stocks and Returns:
Stock A: Start ₹1,000, End ₹1,350 → Return = (1,350-1,000)/1,000 = 35%
Stock B: Start ₹500, End ₹520 → Return = (520-500)/500 = 4%
Stock C: Start ₹800, End ₹720 → Return = (720-800)/800 = -10%
```

**Step 2: Ranking Process**
```
Sort 500 stocks by return (highest to lowest):
Rank 1: Asian Paints (+45.2%)
Rank 2: HDFC Bank (+38.7%)
Rank 3: Infosys (+32.1%)
...
Rank 498: Stock X (-18.4%)
Rank 499: Stock Y (-22.8%)
Rank 500: Stock Z (-28.5%)
```

**Step 3: Portfolio Selection**
```
Select Top 15 stocks (Top 3% of universe)
Selected Portfolio:
1. Asian Paints: +45.2%
2. HDFC Bank: +38.7%
3. Infosys: +32.1%
...
15. TCS: +24.8%
```

**Step 4: Equal Weight Allocation**
```
Portfolio Size: ₹15,00,000
Per Stock Allocation = ₹15,00,000 ÷ 15 = ₹1,00,000

Position Sizes:
Asian Paints: ₹1,00,000 ÷ ₹2,450 = 41 shares
HDFC Bank: ₹1,00,000 ÷ ₹1,680 = 60 shares
Infosys: ₹1,00,000 ÷ ₹1,250 = 80 shares
... and so on
```

#### **Performance Metrics Calculation Examples**

**Sharpe Ratio Calculation**
```
Portfolio Performance Data:
Annual Return: 18.5%
Risk-free Rate: 7%
Portfolio Volatility: 16.8%

Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-free Rate) ÷ Portfolio Volatility
             = (18.5% - 7%) ÷ 16.8%
             = 11.5% ÷ 16.8%
             = 0.685

Interpretation: Good risk-adjusted returns (>0.5 acceptable, >1.0 excellent)
```

**Maximum Drawdown Calculation**
```
Portfolio Value Journey:
Start: ₹10,00,000
Peak: ₹13,20,000 (Month 8)
Trough: ₹10,56,000 (Month 11)
Recovery: ₹13,80,000 (Month 15)

Maximum Drawdown = (Peak - Trough) ÷ Peak
                 = (₹13,20,000 - ₹10,56,000) ÷ ₹13,20,000
                 = ₹2,64,000 ÷ ₹13,20,000
                 = 20%

Recovery Time = Month 15 - Month 8 = 7 months
```

**Win Rate Analysis**
```
Trading System Performance (50 trades):
Winning Trades: 32
Losing Trades: 18

Win Rate = Winning Trades ÷ Total Trades
         = 32 ÷ 50
         = 64%

Average Win: ₹3,500
Average Loss: ₹2,100
Profit Factor = (Win Rate × Avg Win) ÷ (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)
              = (0.64 × ₹3,500) ÷ (0.36 × ₹2,100)
              = ₹2,240 ÷ ₹756
              = 2.96 (Excellent - Above 2.0 preferred)
```

#### **Calendar Spread Calculation Example**

**Nifty Calendar Spread Setup:**
```
Current Nifty: 17,800
Current Month Future: 17,825 (25 points premium)
Next Month Future: 17,860 (60 points premium)
Spread = 17,860 - 17,825 = 35 points

Trade Setup: Sell Current Month, Buy Next Month
Capital Required: Spread margin ≈ ₹40,000 per lot

Profit Scenarios:
If spread narrows to 25 points: Profit = 35 - 25 = 10 points = ₹750
If spread widens to 45 points: Loss = 45 - 35 = 10 points = ₹750

Historical Analysis:
Spread usually trades between 20-50 points
Current 35 points is near middle of range
Mean reversion expected
```

#### **Risk Management Calculations**

**Portfolio Risk Analysis:**
```
Individual Stock Weights and Volatilities:
Stock A: 20% weight, 25% volatility
Stock B: 30% weight, 18% volatility  
Stock C: 50% weight, 22% volatility

Correlation Matrix:
A-B: 0.65, A-C: 0.58, B-C: 0.72

Portfolio Variance = Σ(Wi² × σi²) + Σ(2×Wi×Wj×σi×σj×ρij)
                   = (0.2²×25²) + (0.3²×18²) + (0.5²×22²) + 
                     2×(0.2×0.3×25×18×0.65) + 2×(0.2×0.5×25×22×0.58) + 
                     2×(0.3×0.5×18×22×0.72)
                   = 25 + 29.16 + 121 + 35.1 + 63.8 + 85.54
                   = 359.6

Portfolio Volatility = √359.6 = 18.96%
```

**EXAM FOCUS**: Master the differences between systematic and discretionary approaches, understand the statistical concepts behind pair trading, know the characteristics of momentum vs mean reversion systems, and be familiar with performance evaluation metrics. System development and testing methodologies are increasingly important in modern trading.
