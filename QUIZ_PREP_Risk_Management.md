# QUIZ PREP: Risk Management & Trading Psychology
*Based on Module 9: Risk Management & Trading Psychology*

## 🎯 **RISK MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS**

### **1. UNDERSTANDING RISK**

#### **Types of Risk**
- **Systematic Risk**: Market-wide risk (cannot be diversified away)
  - Economic cycles, interest rate changes, political events
- **Unsystematic Risk**: Company/sector-specific risk (can be diversified)
  - Management issues, product failures, competitive threats

#### **Risk Measurements**
- **Variance**: Measure of volatility in returns
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance (σ)
- **Beta**: Relative risk compared to market (β)
  - β > 1: More volatile than market
  - β < 1: Less volatile than market
  - β = 1: Same volatility as market

#### **Covariance & Correlation**
- **Covariance**: How two assets move together
- **Correlation**: Standardized measure (-1 to +1)
  - +1: Perfect positive correlation
  - 0: No correlation
  - -1: Perfect negative correlation

**💡 Quiz Tip**: Diversification works best with LOW correlation assets!

### **2. PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT**

#### **Portfolio Variance Calculation**
For 2-asset portfolio:
```
σp² = w1²σ1² + w2²σ2² + 2w1w2σ1σ2ρ12
```
Where:
- w = weight of asset
- σ = standard deviation
- ρ = correlation coefficient

#### **Risk Reduction Strategies**
1. **Diversification**: Spread investments across assets
2. **Asset Allocation**: Mix of equity, debt, commodities
3. **Geographic Diversification**: Domestic + international exposure
4. **Sector Diversification**: Avoid concentration in single sector

#### **Optimal Portfolio Construction**
- **Efficient Frontier**: Best risk-return combinations
- **Sharpe Ratio**: (Return - Risk-free rate) / Standard deviation
- **Maximum Diversification**: ~15-20 stocks for equity portfolio

---

### **3. POSITION SIZING STRATEGIES**

#### **Fixed Percentage Method**
- Risk fixed % of capital per trade (typically 1-2%)
- **Formula**: Position size = Account value × Risk % / Stop loss %

#### **Volatility-Based Sizing**
- Adjust position size based on asset volatility
- **Higher volatility** → Smaller position size
- **Lower volatility** → Larger position size

#### **Kelly Criterion**
- **Formula**: f* = (bp - q) / b
  - f* = fraction of capital to bet
  - b = odds of winning
  - p = probability of winning
  - q = probability of losing (1-p)

#### **Position Sizing Rules**
- Never risk more than 2% on single trade
- Maximum 10% in any single stock
- Maintain 20-30% cash for opportunities
- Scale into positions gradually

---

### **4. VALUE AT RISK (VaR)**

#### **Definition & Concept**
- **VaR**: Maximum expected loss over specific time period at given confidence level
- **Example**: 1-day VaR of ₹10,000 at 95% confidence
  - 5% chance of losing more than ₹10,000 in one day

#### **VaR Calculation Methods**
1. **Parametric Method**: Assumes normal distribution
2. **Historical Simulation**: Uses historical price data
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uses random scenarios

#### **Limitations of VaR**
- Doesn't predict extreme events (tail risk)
- Based on historical data (may not reflect future)
- Assumes normal distribution (markets often show fat tails)

### **5. TRADING PSYCHOLOGY**

#### **Common Trading Biases**

**1. Overconfidence Bias**
- Believing you can predict market better than others
- **Solution**: Keep trading journal, track performance

**2. Confirmation Bias**
- Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Solution**: Actively seek contradictory evidence

**3. Loss Aversion**
- Pain of loss feels twice as strong as joy of gain
- **Solution**: Set stop losses before entering trades

**4. Anchoring Bias**
- Over-relying on first piece of information
- **Solution**: Use multiple valuation methods

**5. Herd Mentality**
- Following crowd without independent analysis
- **Solution**: Develop contrarian thinking

#### **Emotional Management**
- **Fear**: Leads to premature selling, missed opportunities
- **Greed**: Results in overtrading, excessive risk-taking
- **Hope**: Prevents cutting losses, holding losing positions
- **Regret**: Causes analysis paralysis

---

### **6. RISK METRICS & RATIOS**

#### **Performance-Adjusted Risk Metrics**

**Sharpe Ratio**
- **Formula**: (Rp - Rf) / σp
- **Interpretation**: Higher is better
- **Good Sharpe**: >1.0 considered good

**Sortino Ratio**
- **Formula**: (Rp - Rf) / Downside deviation
- **Advantage**: Only considers negative volatility

**Maximum Drawdown**
- **Definition**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Importance**: Shows worst-case scenario

**Calmar Ratio**
- **Formula**: Annual return / Maximum drawdown
- **Use**: Risk-adjusted performance measure

#### **Capture Ratios**
- **Upside Capture**: How much of market gains captured
- **Downside Capture**: How much of market losses avoided
- **Ideal**: High upside capture, low downside capture

### **7. RISK MANAGEMENT FOR ENTREPRENEURS**

#### **Business Risk Categories**
1. **Market Risk**: Demand changes, competition
2. **Operational Risk**: Process failures, human errors
3. **Financial Risk**: Cash flow, credit, liquidity
4. **Regulatory Risk**: Policy changes, compliance
5. **Technology Risk**: System failures, cybersecurity

#### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
- **Insurance**: Transfer risk to insurance companies
- **Diversification**: Multiple revenue streams
- **Hedging**: Financial instruments to offset risk
- **Reserves**: Maintain cash buffer for emergencies

#### **Startup Risk Management**
- **Market Validation**: Test before full launch
- **MVP Approach**: Minimum viable product strategy
- **Burn Rate Control**: Monitor cash consumption
- **Scenario Planning**: Best/worst case analysis

## 📊 **KEY RISK FORMULAS & BENCHMARKS**

### **Essential Risk Calculations**

**1. Standard Deviation**
```
σ = √[Σ(Ri - R̄)² / (n-1)]
```

**2. Beta**
```
β = Covariance(Ri, Rm) / Variance(Rm)
```

**3. Sharpe Ratio**
```
Sharpe = (Rp - Rf) / σp
```

**4. Value at Risk (Parametric)**
```
VaR = Portfolio Value × Z-score × σ × √t
```

### **Risk Benchmarks**
- **Good Sharpe Ratio**: >1.0
- **Maximum Portfolio Drawdown**: <20%
- **Single Stock Weight**: <10% of portfolio
- **Cash Allocation**: 10-30% of portfolio
- **Risk per Trade**: <2% of capital

### **Risk Management Hierarchy**
1. **Account Level**: Overall portfolio risk limits
2. **Position Level**: Individual trade risk limits
3. **Trade Level**: Entry, stop loss, target levels
4. **Time Level**: Maximum holding period rules

### **Success Metrics to Track**
- **Win Rate**: % of profitable trades
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Average profit / Average loss
- **Maximum Consecutive Losses**: Psychological limit
- **Recovery Time**: How quickly you bounce back

## 🎯 **QUIZ SUCCESS STRATEGIES**

### **Key Risk Concepts**
1. **Diversification Benefits**: Reduces unsystematic risk
2. **Correlation Impact**: Low correlation improves diversification
3. **Position Sizing**: Most important factor for long-term success
