# QUIZ PREP: Financial Markets Fundamentals
*Based on Module 1: Introduction to Stock Markets*

## üéØ **THE NEED TO INVEST**

### **1. WHY INVEST?**

#### **The Power of Inflation**
- **Definition**: General increase in prices over time
- **Impact**: ‚Çπ100 today ‚â† ‚Çπ100 in future purchasing power
- **Historical Rate**: India averages 6-7% annually
- **Reality Check**: Without investing, money loses value every year

#### **Investment vs Saving**
**Saving:**
- Money kept in banks/fixed deposits
- Safety but low returns (4-6%)
- **Real Return**: Often negative after inflation

**Investing:**
- Money deployed to generate higher returns
- Higher risk but potential for returns above inflation
- **Real Return**: Positive returns after adjusting for inflation

#### **Wealth Creation Example**
**Scenario**: ‚Çπ10,000 monthly for 20 years
**Saving Account @ 5%**: ‚Çπ39.8 Lakhs (vs ‚Çπ24L invested)
**Equity Investment @ 12%**: ‚Çπ89.9 Lakhs (vs ‚Çπ24L invested)
**Difference**: ‚Çπ50.1 Lakhs more through investing!

## üìà **RETURN CALCULATIONS - MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS**

### **3. ABSOLUTE RETURN vs CAGR**

#### **Absolute Return Formula**
**Formula**: [Ending Period Value √∑ Starting Period Value - 1] √ó 100

**Example Calculation**:
```
Purchase Price: ‚Çπ3,030 (Infosys)
Selling Price: ‚Çπ3,550
Absolute Return = [3,550 √∑ 3,030 - 1] √ó 100
                = [1.1716 - 1] √ó 100
                = 0.1716 √ó 100 = 17.16%
```

#### **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) Formula**
**Formula**: {[Ending Value √∑ Starting Value]^(1/number of years) - 1} √ó 100

**Example Calculation**:
```
Purchase Price: ‚Çπ3,030 (Infosys)
Selling Price: ‚Çπ3,550 (after 2 years)
CAGR = {[3,550 √∑ 3,030]^(1/2) - 1} √ó 100
     = {[1.1716]^0.5 - 1} √ó 100
     = {1.082 - 1} √ó 100 = 8.2%
```

#### **When to Use Which Formula**
- **Absolute Return**: Use when holding period is 1 year or less
- **CAGR**: Use when holding period is more than 1 year
- **Annualized Return**: For periods less than 1 year, multiply by (12/months) or (365/days)

**Short-term Example**:
```
6-month return of 17.16%
Annualized Return = 17.16% √ó 2 = 34.32%
```

## üè¢ **MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE**

### **2. STOCK EXCHANGES COMPARISON**

#### **NSE vs BSE: Detailed Comparison**

| **Parameter** | **NSE (National Stock Exchange)** | **BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)** |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Established** | 1992 | 1875 (World's oldest in Asia) |
| **Index** | Nifty 50 | Sensex 30 |
| **Trading System** | NEAT (National Exchange for Automated Trading) | BOLT (BSE OnLine Trading) |
| **Listed Companies** | ~1,800 companies | ~4,000+ companies |
| **Market Cap** | Higher | Lower |
| **Trading Volume** | Higher (preferred by traders) | Lower |
| **Derivatives** | More liquid F&O market | Less liquid F&O market |
| **Technology** | Screen-based from inception | Transitioned from floor to screen |

#### **Why NSE is More Popular for Trading**
- **Higher Liquidity**: Better bid-ask spreads
- **Lower Impact Cost**: Easier to execute large orders
- **Technology Leadership**: Superior trading infrastructure
- **Derivatives Market**: More active F&O trading

### **3. MAJOR INDICES COMPARISON**

#### **Nifty 50 vs Sensex 30: Key Differences**

| **Parameter** | **Nifty 50** | **Sensex 30** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Full Name** | CNX Nifty (CRISIL-NSE Index) | S&P BSE Sensex |
| **Stocks Included** | 50 largest companies | 30 largest companies |
| **Managed By** | India Index Services & Products Ltd (IISL) | S&P Dow Jones Indices |
| **Base Year** | November 3, 1995 (Base: 1000) | 1978-79 (Base: 100) |
| **Calculation** | Free-float market capitalization | Free-float market capitalization |
| **Rebalancing** | Semi-annual | Periodic (as needed) |
| **Sectoral Coverage** | Better sector representation | Concentrated in few sectors |

#### **Index Construction Methodology**
**Common Method**: Free-float Market Capitalization Weighted
**Formula**: Market Cap = Outstanding Shares √ó Current Price
**Weight Assignment**: Higher market cap = Higher weight in index
**Example**: If ITC has 7.6% weight in Nifty, then 7.6% of Nifty's movement comes from ITC

#### **Free Float Market Capitalization Formula**
**Formula**: Free Float Market Cap = Total Outstanding Shares √ó Current Stock Price

**Example Calculation**:
```
Company ABC:
- Total Outstanding Shares = 100 shares
- Current Stock Price = ‚Çπ50
- Free Float Market Cap = 100 √ó 50 = ‚Çπ5,000
```

#### **Index Weight Calculation**
**Formula**: Stock Weight = (Stock's Market Cap √∑ Total Index Market Cap) √ó 100

**Example**:
```
ITC Market Cap = ‚Çπ3,00,000 Crores
Total Nifty Market Cap = ‚Çπ40,00,000 Crores
ITC Weight = (3,00,000 √∑ 40,00,000) √ó 100 = 7.5%
```

#### **Index Calculation Process**
1. **Calculate Market Cap**: For each stock (Shares √ó Price)
2. **Sum Total Market Cap**: Add all constituent stocks
3. **Apply Base Divisor**: Adjust for corporate actions
4. **Index Value**: (Current Market Cap √∑ Base Market Cap) √ó Base Index Value

#### **Index Movement Impact**
**Formula**: Index Change = Œ£(Stock Weight √ó Stock Price Change %)

**Example**:
```
If ITC (7.6% weight) moves up 2%:
Impact on Nifty = 7.6% √ó 2% = 0.152% (or ~15 points if Nifty at 10,000)
```

#### **Index Maintenance**
- **Regular Review**: Semi-annual evaluation of constituents
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Market cap, liquidity, listing history
- **Replacement Rules**: Stocks dropping out replaced by eligible ones
- **Corporate Actions**: Adjust for splits, bonuses, mergers

## üî¢ **CALCULATIONS AND FORMULAS**

### **10. KEY FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS**

#### **Market Capitalization Calculations**
**Formula**: Market Cap = Outstanding Shares √ó Current Share Price
**Free-float Market Cap**: Tradeable shares √ó Current Price
**Example**: 
- Total shares: 100 crores
- Free-float: 40 crores (60% held by promoters)
- Price: ‚Çπ500
- Market Cap: 100 √ó ‚Çπ500 = ‚Çπ50,000 crores
- Free-float Market Cap: 40 √ó ‚Çπ500 = ‚Çπ20,000 crores

#### **Index Weightage Calculation**
**Formula**: Weight = (Stock's Free-float Market Cap √∑ Total Index Market Cap) √ó 100
**Example**: If Reliance has market cap of ‚Çπ10 lakh crores and total Nifty market cap is ‚Çπ100 lakh crores:
Weight = (‚Çπ10 √∑ ‚Çπ100) √ó 100 = 10%

#### **Brokerage Calculations**
**Equity Delivery**: Usually 0.5% or flat fee
**Equity Intraday**: Usually 0.25% or flat fee
**Example**: Buy ‚Çπ1,00,000 worth shares
- Delivery brokerage: ‚Çπ1,00,000 √ó 0.5% = ‚Çπ500
- Plus: STT, exchange charges, GST, SEBI charges

#### **Return Calculations**
**Absolute Return**: (Ending Value - Beginning Value) √∑ Beginning Value √ó 100
**Annualized Return**: ((Ending Value √∑ Beginning Value)^(1/years)) - 1 √ó 100
**Example**: Bought at ‚Çπ100, sold at ‚Çπ150 after 2 years
- Absolute: (150-100)/100 = 50%
- Annualized: (150/100)^(1/2) - 1 = 22.47%
