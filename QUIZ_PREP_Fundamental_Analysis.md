## 🏆 **ADVANCED COMPARISON CONCEPTS**

### **10. QUALITY vs VALUE vs GROWTH INVESTING**

#### **Investment Style Comparison**

| **STYLE** | **FOCUS** | **METRICS** | **RISK PROFILE** | **EXAMPLES** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Quality** | High ROCE, low debt | ROE >20%, D/E <0.5 | Moderate risk | Consistent performers |
| **Value** | Undervalued assets | Low P/E, P/B | Higher risk | Cyclical recoveries |
| **Growth** | Earnings growth | High growth rates | Highest risk | Emerging companies |

#### **DuPont Analysis Framework**

### **6. DETAILED FINANCIAL RATIO CALCULATIONS**

#### **EBITDA Calculation Step-by-Step**
**Formula**: EBITDA = Operating Revenues - Operating Expenses

**Example: Amara Raja Batteries (FY14)**
```
Operating Revenues = Total Revenue - Other Income
                   = ₹3,482 Cr - ₹46 Cr = ₹3,436 Cr

Operating Expenses = Total Expenses - Finance Cost - Depreciation
                   = ₹2,942 Cr - ₹0.7 Cr - ₹65 Cr = ₹2,876 Cr

EBITDA = ₹3,436 Cr - ₹2,876 Cr = ₹560 Cr

EBITDA Margin = ₹560 Cr ÷ ₹3,436 Cr = 16.3%
```

#### **DuPont Model - Detailed ROE Breakdown**
**Formula**: ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage

**Example Calculation:**
```
Component 1: Net Profit Margin = PAT ÷ Revenue = 9.2%

Component 2: Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
- Net Sales FY14 = ₹3,437 Cr
- Total Assets FY13 = ₹1,770 Cr
- Total Assets FY14 = ₹2,139 Cr
- Average Assets = (1,770 + 2,139) ÷ 2 = ₹1,955 Cr
- Asset Turnover = 3,437 ÷ 1,955 = 1.75 times

Component 3: Financial Leverage = Average Assets ÷ Average Equity
- Shareholders Equity FY13 = ₹1,059 Cr
- Shareholders Equity FY14 = ₹1,362 Cr
- Average Equity = (1,059 + 1,362) ÷ 2 = ₹1,211 Cr
- Financial Leverage = 1,955 ÷ 1,211 = 1.61 times

Final ROE = 9.2% × 1.75 × 1.61 = 25.9%
```

#### **P/E Ratio Calculation with Example**
**Formula**: P/E = Current Market Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

**Example:**
```
Step 1: Calculate EPS
PAT = ₹367 Cr
Total Shares = 17.081 Cr
EPS = 367 ÷ 17.081 = ₹21.49 per share

Step 2: Calculate P/E
Current Market Price = ₹661 per share
P/E = 661 ÷ 21.49 = 30.76 times

Interpretation: For every ₹1 of profit, market participants 
are willing to pay ₹30.76
```

#### **ROA Calculation with Tax Shield**
**Formula**: ROA = [Net Income + Interest×(1-Tax Rate)] ÷ Average Total Assets

**Example:**
```
Net Income = ₹367.4 Cr
Finance Cost = ₹7 Cr
Tax Rate = 32%
Tax Shield = 7 × (1 - 0.32) = ₹4.76 Cr
Average Total Assets = ₹1,955 Cr

ROA = (367.4 + 4.76) ÷ 1,955 = 372.16 ÷ 1,955 = 19.03%
```

#### **ROCE Calculation**
**Formula**: ROCE = EBIT ÷ Capital Employed

**Example:**
```
EBIT = ₹537.7 Cr
Capital Employed = Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt + Equity
                 = ₹8.3 Cr + ₹75.9 Cr + ₹1,362 Cr
                 = ₹1,446.2 Cr

ROCE = 537.7 ÷ 1,446.2 = 37.18%
```

#### **Book Value Per Share Calculation**
**Formula**: BV = [Share Capital + Reserves] ÷ Total Shares

**Example:**
```
Share Capital = ₹17.1 Cr
Reserves = ₹1,345.6 Cr
Total Shares = 17.081 Cr

Book Value per Share = (17.1 + 1,345.6) ÷ 17.081 = ₹79.8

P/BV Ratio = Market Price ÷ Book Value
           = 661 ÷ 79.8 = 8.3 times
```
**ROE Decomposition**: ROE = (Profit Margin) × (Asset Turnover) × (Financial Leverage)
**Component Analysis**:
- **Profit Margin**: Operational efficiency
- **Asset Turnover**: Asset utilization
- **Financial Leverage**: Capital structure

#### **Economic Moats Comparison**
**Network Effects**: Value increases with users (social platforms)
**Brand Power**: Premium pricing ability (luxury brands)
**Cost Advantages**: Structural cost benefits (scale, location)
**Switching Costs**: Customer retention through complexity
**Regulatory Barriers**: Licenses, patents protection

**REMEMBER**: Fundamental analysis is about understanding businesses, not just numbers. Quality companies with sustainable competitive advantages, reasonable valuations, and competent management create long-term wealth. Always compare companies within the same industry and analyze trends over multiple years.

**EXAM FOCUS**: Master the differences between participant types, understand financial ratio calculations and interpretations, know when to use different valuation methods, and be able to identify quality business characteristics. Comparative analysis across time periods and peer companies is essential.
