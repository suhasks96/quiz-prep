## 🏆 **ADVANCED COMPARISON CONCEPTS**

### **10. QUALITY vs VALUE vs GROWTH INVESTING**

#### **Investment Style Comparison**

| **STYLE** | **FOCUS** | **METRICS** | **RISK PROFILE** | **EXAMPLES** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Quality** | High ROCE, low debt | ROE >20%, D/E <0.5 | Moderate risk | Consistent performers |

| **Growth** | Earnings growth | High growth rates | Highest risk | Emerging companies |

#### **DuPont Analysis Framework**

### **6. DETAILED FINANCIAL RATIO CALCULATIONS**

#### **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) Calculation Step-by-Step**
**Formula**: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) = Operating Revenues - Operating Expenses

**Example: Amara Raja Batteries (FY14)**
```
Operating Revenues = Total Revenue - Other Income
                   = ₹3,482 Cr - ₹46 Cr = ₹3,436 Cr

Operating Expenses = Total Expenses - Finance Cost - Depreciation
                   = ₹2,942 Cr - ₹0.7 Cr - ₹65 Cr = ₹2,876 Cr

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) = ₹3,436 Cr - ₹2,876 Cr = ₹560 Cr

EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) Margin = ₹560 Cr ÷ ₹3,436 Cr = 16.3%
```

#### **DuPont Model - Detailed ROE (Return on Equity) Breakdown**
**Formula**: ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage

**Example Calculation:**
```
Component 1: Net Profit Margin = PAT ÷ Revenue = 9.2%

Component 2: Asset Turnover = Revenue ÷ Average Total Assets
- Net Sales FY14 = ₹3,437 Cr
- Total Assets FY13 = ₹1,770 Cr
- Total Assets FY14 = ₹2,139 Cr
- Average Assets = (1,770 + 2,139) ÷ 2 = ₹1,955 Cr
- Asset Turnover = 3,437 ÷ 1,955 = 1.75 times

Component 3: Financial Leverage = Average Assets ÷ Average Equity
- Shareholders Equity FY13 = ₹1,059 Cr
- Shareholders Equity FY14 = ₹1,362 Cr
- Average Equity = (1,059 + 1,362) ÷ 2 = ₹1,211 Cr
- Financial Leverage = 1,955 ÷ 1,211 = 1.61 times

Final ROE = 9.2% × 1.75 × 1.61 = 25.9%
```

#### **P/E Ratio Calculation with Example**
**Formula**: P/E = Current Market Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

**Example:**
```
Step 1: Calculate EPS
PAT = ₹367 Cr
Total Shares = 17.081 Cr
EPS = 367 ÷ 17.081 = ₹21.49 per share

Step 2: Calculate P/E
Current Market Price = ₹661 per share
P/E = 661 ÷ 21.49 = 30.76 times

Interpretation: For every ₹1 of profit, market participants 
are willing to pay ₹30.76
```

#### **ROA Calculation with Tax Shield**
**Formula**: ROA = [Net Income + Interest×(1-Tax Rate)] ÷ Average Total Assets

**Example:**
```
Net Income = ₹367.4 Cr
Finance Cost = ₹7 Cr
Tax Rate = 32%
Tax Shield = 7 × (1 - 0.32) = ₹4.76 Cr
Average Total Assets = ₹1,955 Cr

ROA = (367.4 + 4.76) ÷ 1,955 = 372.16 ÷ 1,955 = 19.03%
```

#### **ROCE Calculation**
**Formula**: ROCE = EBIT ÷ Capital Employed

**Example:**
```
EBIT = ₹537.7 Cr
Capital Employed = Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt + Equity
                 = ₹8.3 Cr + ₹75.9 Cr + ₹1,362 Cr
                 = ₹1,446.2 Cr

ROCE = 537.7 ÷ 1,446.2 = 37.18%
```

#### **Book Value Per Share Calculation**
**Formula**: BV = [Share Capital + Reserves] ÷ Total Shares

**Example:**
```
Share Capital = ₹17.1 Cr
Reserves = ₹1,345.6 Cr
Total Shares = 17.081 Cr

Book Value per Share = (17.1 + 1,345.6) ÷ 17.081 = ₹79.8

P/BV (Price to Book Value) Ratio = Market Price ÷ Book Value
           = 661 ÷ 79.8 = 8.3 times
```
**ROE Decomposition**: ROE = (Profit Margin) × (Asset Turnover) × (Financial Leverage)
**Component Analysis**:
- **Profit Margin**: Operational efficiency
- **Asset Turnover**: Asset utilization
- **Financial Leverage**: Capital structure

#### **Economic Moats Comparison**
**Network Effects**: Value increases with users (social platforms)
**Brand Power**: Premium pricing ability (luxury brands)
**Cost Advantages**: Structural cost benefits (scale, location)
**Switching Costs**: Customer retention through complexity
**Regulatory Barriers**: Licenses, patents protection
