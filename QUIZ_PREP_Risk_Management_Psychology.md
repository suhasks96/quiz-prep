## 💰 **POSITION SIZING METHODS COMPARISON**

### **4. CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES**

#### **Position Sizing Technique Matrix**

| **METHOD** | **CALCULATION** | **RISK FOCUS** | **COMPLEXITY** | **SUITABILITY** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Fixed Dollar** | Same amount per trade | Simple risk control | Low | Beginners |
| **Fixed Percentage** | % of total capital | Portfolio percentage | Low | Conservative traders |
| **Volatility-Based** | Based on ATR/volatility | Price movement risk | Medium | Active traders |
| **Kelly Criterion** | Win rate × avg win - loss rate × avg loss | Optimal growth | High | Advanced traders |
| **Risk Parity** | Equal risk contribution | Risk equalization | High | Portfolio managers |

#### **Fixed vs Variable Position Sizing**

**Fixed Dollar Method**:
- **Approach**: Same monetary amount per trade
- **Example**: ₹10,000 per trade regardless of stock price
- **Advantage**: Simple implementation
- **Disadvantage**: Different risk levels per trade

**Fixed Percentage Method**:
- **Approach**: Fixed percentage of total capital
- **Example**: 2% of ₹10 lakh portfolio = ₹20,000 per trade
- **Advantage**: Risk scales with portfolio size
- **Disadvantage**: Same percentage may mean different actual risk

**Volatility-Based Sizing**:
- **Approach**: Inverse relationship with volatility
- **Calculation**: Position Size = Risk Amount ÷ (Stop Distance × Volatility)
- **Advantage**: Equalizes actual risk across trades
- **Disadvantage**: Requires volatility calculations

#### **Kelly Criterion Detailed Analysis**

**Kelly Formula**: f = (bp - q) / b
**Where**:
- f = Fraction of capital to risk
- b = Odds received (reward/risk ratio)
- p = Probability of winning
- q = Probability of losing (1-p)

**Kelly Example**:
- Win Rate: 60% (p = 0.6)
- Loss Rate: 40% (q = 0.4)  
- Avg Win: ₹300, Avg Loss: ₹200
- Reward/Risk: 300/200 = 1.5 (b = 1.5)
- Kelly % = (1.5 × 0.6 - 0.4) / 1.5 = 27%

**Kelly Considerations**:
- **Full Kelly**: Often too aggressive
- **Fractional Kelly**: Use 25-50% of calculated amount
- **Drawdown Risk**: Large positions increase volatility
- **Practical Limits**: Real-world constraints apply

## 🔍 **RISK MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES**

### **7. QUANTITATIVE RISK METRICS COMPARISON**

#### **Risk Measurement Matrix**

| **METRIC** | **CALCULATION** | **INTERPRETATION** | **USE CASE** |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Standard Deviation** | √(Σ(returns - mean)²/n) | Volatility measure | General risk assessment |
| **Value at Risk (VaR)** | Percentile of return distribution | Potential loss at confidence level | Portfolio risk limits |
| **Beta** | Covariance(stock, market) / Variance(market) | Market sensitivity | Systematic risk measure |
| **Maximum Drawdown** | Peak to trough decline | Worst-case loss | Downside risk assessment |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | (Return - RF rate) / Standard Deviation | Risk-adjusted return | Performance comparison |

#### **VaR (Value at Risk) Detailed Analysis**

**VaR Calculation Methods**:

**Historical Method**:
- Use past return distribution
- Select percentile (95%, 99%)
- Simple but assumes past repeats

**Parametric Method**:
- Assume normal distribution
- Use mean and standard deviation
- Quick but distribution assumptions

**Monte Carlo Method**:
- Simulate thousands of scenarios
- More accurate but computationally intensive
- Accounts for complex relationships

**VaR Example**:
Portfolio: ₹10,00,000
Daily VaR (95%): ₹50,000
Interpretation: 95% confidence that daily loss won't exceed ₹50,000

#### **Risk-Adjusted Performance Measures**

**Sharpe Ratio Analysis**:
- **>1.0**: Good risk-adjusted returns
- **>2.0**: Excellent performance
- **<0**: Underperforming risk-free rate
- **Comparison**: Higher Sharpe ratios preferred

**Sortino Ratio Advantage**:
- Focuses only on downside volatility
- More relevant for investors concerned with losses
- Better for skewed return distributions
- Preferred over Sharpe for alternative investments
