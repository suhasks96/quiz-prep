# QUIZ PREP: Personal Finance & Wealth Management
*Based on Module 11: Personal Finance*

## ðŸŽ¯ **CORE WEALTH BUILDING CONCEPTS**

### **1. COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL MATHEMATICS**

#### **Time Value of Money - Deep Dive**
**Core Concept**: Money has time value due to:
1. **Earning Potential**: Can be invested to generate returns
2. **Inflation Impact**: Reduces purchasing power over time
3. **Risk Premium**: Compensation for uncertainty
4. **Opportunity Cost**: Alternative investment foregone

**Advanced TVM Formulas:**
```
Present Value (PV) = FV / (1 + r)^n
Future Value (FV) = PV Ã— (1 + r)^n
Annual Payment (PMT) = [FV Ã— r] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
Present Value of Annuity = PMT Ã— [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r
```

**Real-World Application:**
```
Education Cost Planning:
Current Cost: â‚¹10 lakhs
Inflation: 8% annually
Time: 15 years
Future Cost = 10 Ã— (1.08)^15 = â‚¹31.7 lakhs
Monthly SIP Required = â‚¹31.7L Ã— 0.12 / [(1.12)^15 - 1] = â‚¹8,200
```

#### **Compounding Phenomena**
**The 8th Wonder Effect:**
```
â‚¹1,000 invested at different rates for 30 years:
- 6%: â‚¹5,743 (5.7x growth)
- 10%: â‚¹17,449 (17.4x growth)
- 15%: â‚¹66,212 (66.2x growth)
- 20%: â‚¹2,37,376 (237x growth)
```

**Rule Variations:**
- **Rule of 72**: Doubling time = 72/interest rate
- **Rule of 115**: Tripling time = 115/interest rate
- **Rule of 144**: Quadrupling time = 144/interest rate

**Frequency of Compounding Impact:**
```
â‚¹1,00,000 @ 12% for 10 years:
- Annual: â‚¹3,10,585
- Semi-annual: â‚¹3,20,714
- Quarterly: â‚¹3,26,204
- Monthly: â‚¹3,30,039
- Daily: â‚¹3,31,946
```

#### **Advanced Mathematical Concepts**
**Inflation-Adjusted Returns (Real Returns):**
```
Real Return = [(1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation Rate)] - 1
Example: 12% nominal return, 6% inflation
Real Return = (1.12/1.06) - 1 = 5.66%
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
- **Definition**: Rate at which NPV = 0
- **Application**: Compare different investment options
- **Excel Function**: =IRR(cash flows)

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**
```
WACC = (E/V Ã— Re) + (D/V Ã— Rd Ã— (1-T))
Where: E=Equity, D=Debt, V=Total Value, Re=Cost of Equity, Rd=Cost of Debt, T=Tax Rate
```
