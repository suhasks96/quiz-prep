## 💡 **POSITION SIZING FOR OPTION STRATEGIES**

### **9. STRATEGY-SPECIFIC POSITION SIZING**

#### **Position Sizing Methods by Strategy Type**

| **STRATEGY TYPE** | **SIZING METHOD** | **RISK CALCULATION** | **KEY CONSIDERATIONS** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Long Options** | Premium-based risk | Maximum loss = Premium paid | Simple risk calculation |
| **Short Options** | Margin-based risk | Unlimited loss potential | Complex risk management |
| **Spreads** | Net debit/credit risk | Maximum loss defined | Balanced risk-reward |
| **Straddles/Strangles** | Volatility-based risk | Movement requirement | Breakeven analysis crucial |
| **Iron Condor** | Range-based risk | Profit zone width | High probability trades |

#### **Spread Strategy Position Sizing Examples**

**Bull Call Spread Example**:
**Setup**: Nifty 18000 CE (Call European) (buy) at ₹200, Nifty 18200 CE (Call European) (sell) at ₹100
**Net Debit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Maximum Profit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:1

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹10,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 2% = ₹20,000
**Position Size**: ₹20,000 ÷ ₹100 = 200 spreads
**Total Capital Required**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000
**Maximum Profit Potential**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000

#### **Iron Condor Position Sizing Example**

**Setup**: Nifty Iron Condor
- Sell 17800 PE at ₹80
- Buy 17600 PE at ₹40  
- Sell 18200 CE at ₹80
- Buy 18400 CE at ₹40
**Net Credit**: (₹80 + ₹80) - (₹40 + ₹40) = ₹80 per condor
**Maximum Loss**: ₹200 - ₹80 = ₹120 per condor (strike width - credit)

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹15,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 1.5% = ₹22,500
**Position Size**: ₹22,500 ÷ ₹120 = 187 condors
**Margin Required**: ~₹20,000 per condor = 187 × ₹20,000 = ₹37,40,000
**Issue**: Insufficient capital for desired position size

**Adjusted Position**:
**Available Margin**: ₹3,00,000 (20% of capital)
**Position Size**: ₹3,00,000 ÷ ₹20,000 = 15 condors
**Actual Risk**: 15 × ₹120 = ₹1,800
**Risk Percentage**: ₹1,800 ÷ ₹15,00,000 = 0.12%

### **12. STEP-BY-STEP STRATEGY CALCULATIONS**

#### **Bull Call Spread - Complete Example**
**Trade Setup**: Nifty at 7,850
- **Buy 7800 CE** at ₹79 (Lower Strike - ATM)
- **Sell 7900 CE** at ₹25 (Higher Strike - OTM)
- **Net Debit**: 79 - 25 = ₹54

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Market expires at 7,700 (Below both strikes)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7800, 0] = 0
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 0 - 79 = -₹79
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = -79 + 25 = -₹54 (Maximum Loss)
```

**Scenario 2: Market expires at 7,854 (Breakeven)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7854-7800, 0] = 54
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7854-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 54 - 79 = -₹25
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = -25 + 25 = ₹0 (Breakeven)
```

**Scenario 3: Market expires at 7,900 (At higher strike)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7900-7800, 0] = 100
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7900-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 100 - 79 = +₹21
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = 21 + 25 = +₹46 (Maximum Profit)
```

**Scenario 4: Market expires at 8,000 (Above both strikes)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[8000-7800, 0] = 200
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[8000-7900, 0] = 100

7800 CE P&L = 200 - 79 = +₹121
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 100 = -₹75
Net P&L = 121 - 75 = +₹46 (Maximum Profit achieved)
```

**Bull Call Spread Summary:**
```
Spread = 7900 - 7800 = 100
Net Debit = 79 - 25 = 54
Maximum Loss = Net Debit = ₹54
Maximum Profit = Spread - Net Debit = 100 - 54 = ₹46
Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Debit = 7800 + 54 = 7,854
```

7400 PE P&L = 73 - 0 = +₹73
Net P&L = 35 + 73 = +₹108 (Maximum Profit)
```

**Scenario 3: Market expires at 7,508 (Breakeven)**
```
7600 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7600-7508, 0] = 92
7400 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7400-7508, 0] = 0

7600 PE P&L = 92 - 165 = -₹73
7400 PE P&L = 73 - 0 = +₹73
Net P&L = -73 + 73 = ₹0 (Breakeven)
```

**Scenario 4: Market expires at 7,800 (Above both strikes)**
```
7600 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7600-7800, 0] = 0

7400 PE P&L = 73 - 0 = +₹73
Net P&L = -165 + 73 = -₹92 (Maximum Loss)
```

**Bear Put Spread Summary:**
```
Spread = 7600 - 7400 = 200
Net Debit = 165 - 73 = 92
Maximum Loss = Net Debit = ₹92
Maximum Profit = Spread - Net Debit = 200 - 92 = ₹108
Breakeven = Higher Strike - Net Debit = 7600 - 92 = 7,508
```

7600 CE P&L = 400 - 77 = +₹323
7600 PE P&L = 0 - 88 = -₹88
Net P&L = 323 - 88 = +₹235
```

**Long Straddle Summary:**
```
Net Premium Paid = 77 + 88 = 165
Maximum Loss = Net Premium = ₹165 (occurs at ATM)
Maximum Profit = Unlimited (in either direction)
Upper Breakeven = ATM + Net Premium = 7600 + 165 = 7,765
Lower Breakeven = ATM - Net Premium = 7600 - 165 = 7,435
```

#### **Short Strangle - Complete Example**
**Trade Setup**: Nifty at 7,800 (between strikes)
- **Sell 7700 PE** at ₹28 (OTM Put)
- **Sell 8100 CE** at ₹32 (OTM Call)  
- **Net Credit**: 28 + 32 = ₹60

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Market expires at 7,300 (Below put strike)**
```
7700 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7300, 0] = 400
8100 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7300-8100, 0] = 0

7700 PE P&L = 28 - 400 = -₹372
8100 CE P&L = 32 - 0 = +₹32
Net P&L = -372 + 32 = -₹340
```

**Scenario 2: Market expires at 7,640 (Lower breakeven)**
```
7700 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7640, 0] = 60
8100 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7640-8100, 0] = 0

7700 PE P&L = 28 - 60 = -₹32
8100 CE P&L = 32 - 0 = +₹32
Net P&L = -32 + 32 = ₹0 (Breakeven)
```

**Scenario 3: Market expires at 7,900 (Between strikes - Maximum profit)**
```
7700 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7900, 0] = 0
8100 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7900-8100, 0] = 0

7700 PE P&L = 28 - 0 = +₹28
8100 CE P&L = 32 - 0 = +₹32
Net P&L = 28 + 32 = +₹60 (Maximum Profit)
```

**Scenario 4: Market expires at 8,160 (Upper breakeven)**
```
7700 PE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-8160, 0] = 0
8100 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[8160-8100, 0] = 60

7700 PE P&L = 28 - 0 = +₹28
8100 CE P&L = 32 - 60 = -₹28
Net P&L = 28 - 28 = ₹0 (Breakeven)
```

**Short Strangle Summary:**
```
Net Credit Received = 28 + 32 = 60
Maximum Profit = Net Credit = ₹60 (between strikes)
Maximum Loss = Unlimited (beyond breakevens)
Upper Breakeven = Call Strike + Net Credit = 8100 + 60 = 8,160
Lower Breakeven = Put Strike - Net Credit = 7700 - 60 = 7,640
```

#### **Quick Decision Framework**
**Market Outlook** → **Strategy Type** → **Risk Tolerance** → **Strategy Selection**

**Bullish Moderate**: Bull call spread or bull put spread
**Bearish Moderate**: Bear call spread or bear put spread

**REMEMBER**: Option strategies are about probability, not certainty. Choose strategies that match your market outlook, risk tolerance, and capital requirements. Spreads provide better risk management than naked positions but limit profit potential. Position sizing is crucial for managing portfolio risk - never allocate more than 2-3% of capital to any single strategy. Master the basic spreads before attempting complex multi-leg strategies.

**EXAM FOCUS**: Understand the trade-offs between different strategy types, know how to calculate maximum profit/loss and breakeven points, master position sizing methodologies for different strategies, master the selection criteria for different market environments, and be familiar with risk management techniques for multi-leg positions. Strategy-specific position sizing calculations are increasingly tested in professional exams.
