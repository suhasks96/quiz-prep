## 💡 **POSITION SIZING FOR OPTION STRATEGIES**

### **9. STRATEGY-SPECIFIC POSITION SIZING**

#### **Position Sizing Methods by Strategy Type**

| **STRATEGY TYPE** | **SIZING METHOD** | **RISK CALCULATION** | **KEY CONSIDERATIONS** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Long Options** | Premium-based risk | Maximum loss = Premium paid | Simple risk calculation |
| **Short Options** | Margin-based risk | Unlimited loss potential | Complex risk management |

| **Straddles/Strangles** | Volatility-based risk | Movement requirement | Breakeven analysis crucial |
| **Iron Condor** | Range-based risk | Profit zone width | High probability trades |

#### **Spread Strategy Position Sizing Examples**

**Bull Call Spread Example**:
**Setup**: Nifty 18000 CE (Call European) (buy) at ₹200, Nifty 18200 CE (Call European) (sell) at ₹100
**Net Debit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Maximum Profit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:1

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹10,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 2% = ₹20,000
**Position Size**: ₹20,000 ÷ ₹100 = 200 spreads
**Total Capital Required**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000
**Maximum Profit Potential**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000

#### **Iron Condor Position Sizing Example**

**Setup**: Nifty Iron Condor
- Sell 17800 PE at ₹80
- Buy 17600 PE at ₹40  
- Sell 18200 CE at ₹80
- Buy 18400 CE at ₹40
**Net Credit**: (₹80 + ₹80) - (₹40 + ₹40) = ₹80 per condor
**Maximum Loss**: ₹200 - ₹80 = ₹120 per condor (strike width - credit)

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹15,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 1.5% = ₹22,500
**Position Size**: ₹22,500 ÷ ₹120 = 187 condors
**Margin Required**: ~₹20,000 per condor = 187 × ₹20,000 = ₹37,40,000
**Issue**: Insufficient capital for desired position size

**Adjusted Position**:
**Available Margin**: ₹3,00,000 (20% of capital)
**Position Size**: ₹3,00,000 ÷ ₹20,000 = 15 condors
**Actual Risk**: 15 × ₹120 = ₹1,800
**Risk Percentage**: ₹1,800 ÷ ₹15,00,000 = 0.12%

### **19. EARNINGS VOLATILITY STRATEGIES**

#### **Pre-Earnings Setup Strategies**

| **STRATEGY** | **VOLATILITY VIEW** | **SETUP TIMING** | **PROFIT DRIVER** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Long Straddle** | Increase after earnings | 1-2 weeks before | Large stock move |
| **Short Straddle** | Decrease after earnings | Day before earnings | Time decay post-earnings |
| **Iron Condor** | Stays range-bound | 1-2 weeks before | Limited movement |
| **Calendar Spread** | Vol expansion then contraction | 2-3 weeks before | Theta collection |

#### **Earnings Volatility Lifecycle**
**Phase 1 (4-6 weeks before)**: Low implied volatility (IV)
**Phase 2 (2-3 weeks before)**: IV starts rising
**Phase 3 (1 week before)**: IV peaks
**Phase 4 (Post-earnings)**: IV collapses (vol crush)

#### **Volatility Crush Strategy**
**Setup**: Sell high IV options before earnings
**Execution**: Close positions immediately after earnings
**Risk Management**: Defined risk spreads only

**Example - Short Iron Condor on Earnings:**
```
Setup (1 day before earnings):
- Sell 2,850 Put at ₹45 (IV = 35%)
- Buy 2,800 Put at ₹25 (IV = 33%)
- Sell 3,150 Call at ₹40 (IV = 35%)
- Buy 3,200 Call at ₹25 (IV = 33%)
Net Credit: ₹35

Post-Earnings (IV drops to 20%):
- Collect ₹20-25 profit from vol crush even if stock moves within range
```

#### **Earnings Straddle Management**
**Entry Timing**: 7-10 days before earnings for volatility expansion
**Exit Strategy**: 
- 50% profit: Take profits early
- Day before earnings: Avoid vol crush risk
- Post-earnings: Only if large move exceeds volatility crush

#### **Sector Earnings Strategies**
**Index Options**: Play overall sector earnings impact
**Relative Value**: Long individual stock, short index
**Dispersion Trading**: Long single stocks, short index
**Calendar Strategies**: Different earnings dates within sector

### **20. GREEKS-BASED STRATEGY MANAGEMENT**

#### **Delta Management Across Strategies**

| **STRATEGY** | **INITIAL DELTA** | **MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE** | **ADJUSTMENT TRIGGER** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Long Straddle** | ~0 (delta neutral) | Add/remove stock hedge | Delta > ±20 |
| **Iron Condor** | ~0 (delta neutral) | Adjust strikes | Delta > ±10 |
| **Covered Call** | ~70-80 | Roll strikes | Delta changes significantly |
| **Bull Call Spread** | ~30-50 | Roll up/out | Profitable delta capture |

#### **Gamma Scalping in Options**
**Concept**: Profit from gamma by delta hedging
**Method**: Buy/sell stock to maintain delta neutrality
**Profitability**: Depends on realized volatility vs implied volatility

**Gamma Scalping Example:**
```
Position: Long 100 ATM calls, each with delta 0.50, gamma 0.05
Initial hedge: Short 50 shares

Stock moves up ₹10:
New delta per call = 0.50 + (0.05 × 10) = 1.00
Need to sell 50 more shares to maintain neutrality

Profit from gamma = 0.5 × gamma × (move)² × contracts
                  = 0.5 × 0.05 × 100 × 100 = ₹250
```

#### **Theta Decay Strategy Management**
**Time Decay Acceleration**: Theta increases as expiry approaches
**Optimal Timing**: Sell options 30-45 days before expiry
**Management**: Close at 50% profit or 21 days before expiry

**Theta Collection Optimization:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 0.15-0.30 delta options for theta collection
- **Avoid**: High gamma positions requiring frequent adjustments
- **Target**: 1-2% monthly return from theta strategies

#### **Vega Risk Management**
**Volatility Exposure**: Monitor net vega across portfolio
**Hedging**: Use VIX (Volatility Index) options or volatility ETFs
**Timing**: Reduce vega exposure before known volatility events

### **21. INSTITUTIONAL POSITION SIZING METHODS**

#### **Advanced Position Sizing Models**

| **METHOD** | **CALCULATION** | **BEST FOR** | **RISK CONTROL** |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Fixed Fractional** | Risk fixed % of capital | Conservative strategies | High |
| **Kelly Criterion** | f = (bp - q) / b | High win rate strategies | Medium |
| **Volatility Scaling** | Position ∝ 1/volatility | All strategies | High |
| **Greeks-Based** | Risk per unit greek | Complex strategies | Very High |

#### **Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**
**Formula**: Position Size = Target Risk ÷ (Strategy Risk × Implied Volatility)
**Advantage**: Automatically adjusts for market volatility
**Application**: Larger positions in low vol, smaller in high vol

**Example:**
```
Target Risk: ₹10,000 per trade
Strategy: Iron Condor with ₹2,000 max loss at 20% IV
Current IV: 25%

Base Position = ₹10,000 ÷ ₹2,000 = 5 contracts
Volatility Adjustment = 20% ÷ 25% = 0.8
Final Position = 5 × 0.8 = 4 contracts
```

#### **Greeks-Based Position Limits**
**Delta Limits**: Maximum directional exposure
**Gamma Limits**: Maximum rebalancing requirements
**Vega Limits**: Maximum volatility exposure
**Theta Targets**: Minimum time decay collection

**Professional Limits Example:**
```
Portfolio Limits:
- Net Delta: ±₹50,000 per 1% move
- Net Gamma: ±₹5,000 per 1% move squared
- Net Vega: ±₹1,00,000 per 1% vol change
- Net Theta: +₹2,000 per day minimum
```

#### **Risk Parity in Options**
**Concept**: Equal risk contribution from each position
**Calculation**: Risk Contribution = Position Size × Individual Risk
**Rebalancing**: Adjust positions to maintain equal risk

#### **IV Rank-Based Strategy Selection**
**IV Rank Formula**: (Current IV - 52-week Low IV) ÷ (52-week High IV - 52-week Low IV)

**Strategy Selection by IV Rank:**
- **IV Rank > 80%**: Sell premium (short straddles, iron condors)
- **IV Rank 20-80%**: Neutral strategies (iron condors, calendars)  
- **IV Rank < 20%**: Buy premium (long straddles, calendars)

## 🔢 **DETAILED MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS**

### **12. STEP-BY-STEP STRATEGY CALCULATIONS**

#### **Bull Call Spread - Complete Example**
**Trade Setup**: Nifty at 7,850
- **Buy 7800 CE** at ₹79 (Lower Strike - ATM)
- **Sell 7900 CE** at ₹25 (Higher Strike - OTM)
- **Net Debit**: 79 - 25 = ₹54

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Market expires at 7,700 (Below both strikes)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7800, 0] = 0
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7700-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 0 - 79 = -₹79
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = -79 + 25 = -₹54 (Maximum Loss)
```

**Scenario 2: Market expires at 7,854 (Breakeven)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7854-7800, 0] = 54
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7854-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 54 - 79 = -₹25
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = -25 + 25 = ₹0 (Breakeven)
```

**Scenario 3: Market expires at 7,900 (At higher strike)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7900-7800, 0] = 100
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[7900-7900, 0] = 0

7800 CE P&L = 100 - 79 = +₹21
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 0 = +₹25
Net P&L = 21 + 25 = +₹46 (Maximum Profit)
```

**Scenario 4: Market expires at 8,000 (Above both strikes)**
```
7800 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[8000-7800, 0] = 200
7900 CE Intrinsic Value = Max[8000-7900, 0] = 100

7800 CE P&L = 200 - 79 = +₹121
7900 CE P&L = 25 - 100 = -₹75
Net P&L = 121 - 75 = +₹46 (Maximum Profit achieved)
```

**Bull Call Spread Summary:**
```
Spread = 7900 - 7800 = 100
Net Debit = 79 - 25 = 54
Maximum Loss = Net Debit = ₹54
Maximum Profit = Spread - Net Debit = 100 - 54 = ₹46

**REMEMBER**: Option strategies are about probability, not certainty. Choose strategies that match your market outlook, risk tolerance, and capital requirements. Spreads provide better risk management than naked positions but limit profit potential. Position sizing is crucial for managing portfolio risk - never allocate more than 2-3% of capital to any single strategy. Master the basic spreads before attempting complex multi-leg strategies.

**EXAM FOCUS**: Understand the trade-offs between different strategy types, know how to calculate maximum profit/loss and breakeven points, master position sizing methodologies for different strategies, master the selection criteria for different market environments, and be familiar with risk management techniques for multi-leg positions. Strategy-specific position sizing calculations are increasingly tested in professional exams.
