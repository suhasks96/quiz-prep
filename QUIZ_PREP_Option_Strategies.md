## 💡 **POSITION SIZING FOR OPTION STRATEGIES**

### **9. STRATEGY-SPECIFIC POSITION SIZING**

#### **Position Sizing Methods by Strategy Type**

| **STRATEGY TYPE** | **SIZING METHOD** | **RISK CALCULATION** | **KEY CONSIDERATIONS** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Long Options** | Premium-based risk | Maximum loss = Premium paid | Simple risk calculation |
| **Short Options** | Margin-based risk | Unlimited loss potential | Complex risk management |

| **Straddles/Strangles** | Volatility-based risk | Movement requirement | Breakeven analysis crucial |
| **Iron Condor** | Range-based risk | Profit zone width | High probability trades |

#### **Spread Strategy Position Sizing Examples**

**Bull Call Spread Example**:
**Setup**: Nifty 18000 CE (Call European) (buy) at ₹200, Nifty 18200 CE (Call European) (sell) at ₹100
**Net Debit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Maximum Profit**: ₹200 - ₹100 = ₹100 per spread
**Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:1

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹10,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 2% = ₹20,000
**Position Size**: ₹20,000 ÷ ₹100 = 200 spreads
**Total Capital Required**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000
**Maximum Profit Potential**: 200 × ₹100 = ₹20,000

#### **Iron Condor Position Sizing Example**

**Setup**: Nifty Iron Condor
- Sell 17800 PE at ₹80
- Buy 17600 PE at ₹40  
- Sell 18200 CE at ₹80
- Buy 18400 CE at ₹40
**Net Credit**: (₹80 + ₹80) - (₹40 + ₹40) = ₹80 per condor
**Maximum Loss**: ₹200 - ₹80 = ₹120 per condor (strike width - credit)

**Position Sizing Calculation**:
**Trading Capital**: ₹15,00,000
**Risk per Trade**: 1.5% = ₹22,500
**Position Size**: ₹22,500 ÷ ₹120 = 187 condors
**Margin Required**: ~₹20,000 per condor = 187 × ₹20,000 = ₹37,40,000
**Issue**: Insufficient capital for desired position size

**Adjusted Position**:
**Available Margin**: ₹3,00,000 (20% of capital)
**Position Size**: ₹3,00,000 ÷ ₹20,000 = 15 condors
**Actual Risk**: 15 × ₹120 = ₹1,800
**Risk Percentage**: ₹1,800 ÷ ₹15,00,000 = 0.12%

### **19. EARNINGS VOLATILITY STRATEGIES**

#### **Pre-Earnings Setup Strategies**

| **STRATEGY** | **VOLATILITY VIEW** | **SETUP TIMING** | **PROFIT DRIVER** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Long Straddle** | Increase after earnings | 1-2 weeks before | Large stock move |
| **Short Straddle** | Decrease after earnings | Day before earnings | Time decay post-earnings |
| **Iron Condor** | Stays range-bound | 1-2 weeks before | Limited movement |
| **Calendar Spread** | Vol expansion then contraction | 2-3 weeks before | Theta collection |

#### **Earnings Volatility Lifecycle**
**Phase 1 (4-6 weeks before)**: Low implied volatility (IV)
**Phase 2 (2-3 weeks before)**: IV starts rising
**Phase 3 (1 week before)**: IV peaks
**Phase 4 (Post-earnings)**: IV collapses (vol crush)

#### **Volatility Crush Strategy**
**Setup**: Sell high IV options before earnings
**Execution**: Close positions immediately after earnings
**Risk Management**: Defined risk spreads only

**Example - Short Iron Condor on Earnings:**
```
Setup (1 day before earnings):
- Sell 2,850 Put at ₹45 (IV = 35%)
- Buy 2,800 Put at ₹25 (IV = 33%)
- Sell 3,150 Call at ₹40 (IV = 35%)
- Buy 3,200 Call at ₹25 (IV = 33%)
Net Credit: ₹35

Post-Earnings (IV drops to 20%):
- Collect ₹20-25 profit from vol crush even if stock moves within range
```

#### **Earnings Straddle Management**
**Entry Timing**: 7-10 days before earnings for volatility expansion
**Exit Strategy**: 
- 50% profit: Take profits early
- Day before earnings: Avoid vol crush risk
- Post-earnings: Only if large move exceeds volatility crush

#### **Sector Earnings Strategies**
**Index Options**: Play overall sector earnings impact
**Relative Value**: Long individual stock, short index
**Dispersion Trading**: Long single stocks, short index
**Calendar Strategies**: Different earnings dates within sector

### **20. GREEKS-BASED STRATEGY MANAGEMENT**

#### **Delta Management Across Strategies**

| **STRATEGY** | **INITIAL DELTA** | **MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE** | **ADJUSTMENT TRIGGER** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Long Straddle** | ~0 (delta neutral) | Add/remove stock hedge | Delta > ±20 |
| **Iron Condor** | ~0 (delta neutral) | Adjust strikes | Delta > ±10 |
| **Covered Call** | ~70-80 | Roll strikes | Delta changes significantly |
| **Bull Call Spread** | ~30-50 | Roll up/out | Profitable delta capture |

#### **Gamma Scalping in Options**
**Concept**: Profit from gamma by delta hedging
**Method**: Buy/sell stock to maintain delta neutrality
**Profitability**: Depends on realized volatility vs implied volatility

**Gamma Scalping Example:**
```
Position: Long 100 ATM calls, each with delta 0.50, gamma 0.05
Initial hedge: Short 50 shares

Stock moves up ₹10:
New delta per call = 0.50 + (0.05 × 10) = 1.00
Need to sell 50 more shares to maintain neutrality

Profit from gamma = 0.5 × gamma × (move)² × contracts
                  = 0.5 × 0.05 × 100 × 100 = ₹250
```

#### **Theta Decay Strategy Management**
**Time Decay Acceleration**: Theta increases as expiry approaches
**Optimal Timing**: Sell options 30-45 days before expiry
**Management**: Close at 50% profit or 21 days before expiry

**Theta Collection Optimization:**
- **Sweet Spot**: 0.15-0.30 delta options for theta collection
- **Avoid**: High gamma positions requiring frequent adjustments
- **Target**: 1-2% monthly return from theta strategies

#### **Vega Risk Management**
**Volatility Exposure**: Monitor net vega across portfolio
**Hedging**: Use VIX (Volatility Index) options or volatility ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)
**Timing**: Reduce vega exposure before known volatility events

### **21. INSTITUTIONAL POSITION SIZING METHODS**

#### **Advanced Position Sizing Models**

| **METHOD** | **CALCULATION** | **BEST FOR** | **RISK CONTROL** |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Fixed Fractional** | Risk fixed % of capital | Conservative strategies | High |
| **Kelly Criterion** | f = (bp - q) / b | High win rate strategies | Medium |
| **Volatility Scaling** | Position ∝ 1/volatility | All strategies | High |
| **Greeks-Based** | Risk per unit greek | Complex strategies | Very High |

#### **Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**
**Formula**: Position Size = Target Risk ÷ (Strategy Risk × Implied Volatility)
**Advantage**: Automatically adjusts for market volatility
**Application**: Larger positions in low vol, smaller in high vol

**Example:**
```
Target Risk: ₹10,000 per trade
Strategy: Iron Condor with ₹2,000 max loss at 20% IV
Current IV: 25%

Base Position = ₹10,000 ÷ ₹2,000 = 5 contracts
Volatility Adjustment = 20% ÷ 25% = 0.8
Final Position = 5 × 0.8 = 4 contracts
```

#### **Greeks-Based Position Limits**
**Delta Limits**: Maximum directional exposure
**Gamma Limits**: Maximum rebalancing requirements
**Vega Limits**: Maximum volatility exposure
**Theta Targets**: Minimum time decay collection

**Professional Limits Example:**
```
Portfolio Limits:
- Net Delta: ±₹50,000 per 1% move
- Net Gamma: ±₹5,000 per 1% move squared
- Net Vega: ±₹1,00,000 per 1% vol change
- Net Theta: +₹2,000 per day minimum
```

#### **Risk Parity in Options**
**Concept**: Equal risk contribution from each position
**Calculation**: Risk Contribution = Position Size × Individual Risk
**Rebalancing**: Adjust positions to maintain equal risk

### **22. PROFESSIONAL STRATEGY SELECTION**

| **Trending Down** | High | Bear spreads, protective puts | Bull strategies |
| **Range-Bound** | Low | Iron condors, strangles | Directional strategies |
| **High Volatility** | Very High | Short premium strategies | Long premium strategies |

#### **IV Rank-Based Strategy Selection**
**IV Rank Formula**: (Current IV - 52-week Low IV) ÷ (52-week High IV - 52-week Low IV)

**Strategy Selection by IV Rank:**
- **IV Rank > 80%**: Sell premium (short straddles, iron condors)
- **IV Rank 20-80%**: Neutral strategies (iron condors, calendars)  
- **IV Rank < 20%**: Buy premium (long straddles, calendars)

**IV Percentile**: The percentage of trading days in the past year when IV was lower than the current level, used for volatility-based strategy selection.

**DTE (Days to Expiration)**: The number of calendar days remaining until option expiration, affecting time decay and strategy management.

**ROI (Return on Investment)**: The percentage return on the capital invested in an option strategy, calculated as profit/loss divided by capital deployed.

**ROC (Return on Capital)**: Similar to ROI but specifically referring to the return on the capital at risk in defined-risk strategies.

**BPR (Buying Power Reduction)**: The amount of buying power that gets utilized when entering an option strategy, important for position sizing.

**P&L (Profit and Loss)**: The monetary gain or loss from an options position, tracked in real-time and at expiration.
