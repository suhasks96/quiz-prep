## üßÆ **MASTER FORMULA REFERENCE**

### **üìä VALUATION & ANALYSIS**
```
P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share √∑ Earnings per Share
P/B Ratio = Market Price per Share √∑ Book Value per Share
ROE = Net Income √∑ Shareholders' Equity
ROA = Net Income √∑ Total Assets
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt √∑ Total Equity
Current Ratio = Current Assets √∑ Current Liabilities
```

### **üìà OPTIONS PRICING & GREEKS**
```
Call Intrinsic Value = Max(Stock Price - Strike Price, 0)
Put Intrinsic Value = Max(Strike Price - Stock Price, 0)
Time Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
Call Breakeven = Strike Price + Premium Paid
Put Breakeven = Strike Price - Premium Paid

Delta Range: Calls (0 to 1), Puts (-1 to 0)
Gamma: Highest for ATM options near expiry
Theta: Always negative for long options
Vega: Always positive for long options
```

### **üìâ RISK MANAGEMENT**
```
Portfolio Variance = w‚ÇÅ¬≤œÉ‚ÇÅ¬≤ + w‚ÇÇ¬≤œÉ‚ÇÇ¬≤ + 2w‚ÇÅw‚ÇÇœÉ‚ÇÅœÉ‚ÇÇœÅ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-free Rate) √∑ Standard Deviation
Kelly Criterion = (bp - q) √∑ b
Beta = Covariance(Stock, Market) √∑ Variance(Market)
VaR = Portfolio Value √ó Z-score √ó Standard Deviation
```

### **üí∞ PERSONAL FINANCE**
```
Compound Interest = P(1 + r)^t
Rule of 72 = 72 √∑ Annual Return Rate
Real Return = (1 + Nominal Return) √∑ (1 + Inflation) - 1
NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) √∑ Outstanding Units
Future Value of Annuity = PMT √ó [((1 + r)^n - 1) √∑ r]
```

### **üåç CURRENCY & COMMODITIES**
```
Interest Rate Parity: F/S = (1 + rd) √∑ (1 + rf)
Gold Price (INR) = (International Price √ó USD-INR) √∑ 31.1035
Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Rate √ó (Foreign Price √∑ Domestic Price)
Purchasing Power Parity = S‚ÇÅ/S‚ÇÄ = (1 + œÄd) √∑ (1 + œÄf)
```
