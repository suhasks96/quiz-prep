## ðŸŽ¯ **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS FUNDAMENTALS**

### **1. WHAT IS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS?**

#### **Definition & Core Concept**

- **Goal**: Identify short-term trading opportunities based on market trends
- **Time Horizon**: Minutes to weeks (short-term focus)

#### **TA vs FA Analogy**
**Technical Analysis = Crowd Watching**
- Like choosing a restaurant by observing which has the most customers
- Assumes the crowd (market) knows best
- Focus on "what" is happening, not "why"

**Fundamental Analysis = Food Research**
- Like researching ingredients, cooking methods, taste-testing
- Deep analysis of company fundamentals
- Focus on "why" prices should move

**ðŸ’¡ Quiz Tip**: TA is for SHORT-TERM trading, FA is for LONG-TERM investing!
